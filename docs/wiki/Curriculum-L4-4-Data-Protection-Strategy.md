# L4.4 — Enterprise Data Protection Strategy 🟣

**📍 [Level 4 · Protect](Curriculum-Level-4-Protect.md)** · Chapter 4 of 4 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [L4.3 — Operational Backup Management](Curriculum-L4-3-Backup-Operations.md) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [🗺️ Curriculum Map](Curriculum-Map.md)

**Goal:** turn per-resource backup into a policy with a defensible price. The
new long-retention policy tiers its own tail into archive, and the arithmetic
justifies every year of it.

**The IaC lesson:** a retention policy is a financial commitment expressed as
parameters — with the rates written as comments beside them, one code review
checks the arithmetic and the implementation in the same diff.

| Who this is for | Time | You need first | Cost while it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chapter 4 of Level 4 · everyone | ~20 min | **L4.1** and **L4.3** | 🟣 ~$0.01/hr added · ~$2.10/hr running total, and growing |

> [!WARNING]
> **Level 4 is the only level whose cost keeps rising with nothing changed.**
> Retained recovery points accumulate — a 7-year yearly policy is a bill that
> grows every January. Price it here, on a lab database, before agreeing to it.

## What you're building

A second backup policy lands beside the daily one L4.1 created — the same
additive, never-edit-what-another-template-owns pattern L2.1 used. It carries
the compliance retention shape, plus the tiering rule that keeps that shape
affordable by moving the long tail into the archive tier.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

A second backup policy alongside the daily one L4.1 created — added as a child
of the vault, the same additive pattern L2.1 used for diagnostic settings, never
by editing the vault another template owns.

The new policy carries the compliance shape: 30 daily, 12 monthly, and 7 yearly
recovery points. The green box is the lever that makes that affordable — a
tiering rule moves everything older than six months into the archive tier at
$0.0027/GB/month against $0.0224 standard, roughly an 88% cut on the long tail
**without shortening the retention promise**. That is why archiving beats
trimming retention as a first move.

The two red boxes are things this chapter deliberately cannot do. Redundancy and
cross-region restore were frozen when L4.1 protected its first item. And the
governance policy assignment hits the same wall as L2.4: Contributor cannot
create one.

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — immutability, and why this template does not set it</b></summary>

<br>

Immutability is not set here, and that is deliberate. Vault immutability
belongs to L4.1, and its `Locked` state cannot be undone **by anyone,
including Microsoft support**. That is the entire point of it — an attacker
with full admin rights still cannot shorten your retention. It is also exactly
why no template should set it as a convenience. Decide it consciously, in
L4.1, with someone else reading the pull request.

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L4.4-data-protection-strategy/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Then get it to do the arithmetic you would otherwise skip:**

> Using the rates in the comments of `curriculum/L4.4-data-protection-strategy/main.bicep`, calculate the monthly backup storage cost for four 30 GB VMs under this policy after one year and after seven, with and without archive tiering. Show the working.

The gap between those four numbers is the business case for tiering, and it is
the slide that ends this level. Sanity-check the rates against the
[Curriculum Cost Model](Curriculum-Cost-Model.md)
before you quote them to anyone.

## ✅ Verify it

1. **Both policies exist side by side:**

   ```powershell
   az backup policy list --vault-name "rsv-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-backup" -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     --query "[].{name:name, type:properties.backupManagementType}" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** the daily policy from L4.1 and the long-term one from
   here. Nothing was replaced — move a single item onto the new policy and leave
   the rest, so you can compare.

2. **The tiering rule is really there:**

   ```powershell
   az backup policy show --vault-name "rsv-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-backup" -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     -n "bkpol-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-longterm" --query "properties.tieringPolicy" -o json
   ```

   **You should see:** `TierAfter` at 6 months. Archive tiering has a minimum
   retention requirement, so a policy that keeps recovery points for less than
   that cannot use it — another case where the platform constrains the design.

3. **Confirm what L4.1 closed off:**

   ```powershell
   az backup vault backup-properties show -n "rsv-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-backup" -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     --query "{redundancy:storageModelType, crossRegionRestore:crossRegionRestoreFlag}" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** whatever L4.1 chose. If cross-region restore is `false`
   and your strategy needs it, the honest answer is that this vault cannot
   deliver it — and rebuilding a vault means re-protecting everything and losing
   the recovery point history. That consequence is the reason L4.1 asked first.

4. **Write the strategy down.** You now have retention shapes, redundancy, a
   tiering rule, alerting from L4.3 and a restore drill result. Produce a
   one-page data protection standard with a dollar figure per line and an RPO
   and RTO per tier. That document, not the deployment, is the output of
   Level 4 — and the numbers in it are defensible because you measured them.

## ➡️ What carries forward

Level 4 is complete: the estate is protected, monitored, rehearsed and costed.
**Level 5** puts Microsoft Sentinel on the workspace L3.3 started filling — and
needs a Microsoft Entra ID role for the first time. **Level 6** protects against
losing a region rather than losing data.
