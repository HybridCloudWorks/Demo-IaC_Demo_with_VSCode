# L4.2 — PaaS Protection 🟣

**📍 [Level 4 · Protect](Curriculum-Level-4-Protect.md)** · Chapter 2 of 4 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [L4.1 — Backup Fundamentals](Curriculum-L4-1-Backup-Fundamentals.md) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [L4.3 — Operational Backup Management](Curriculum-L4-3-Backup-Operations.md)

**Goal:** protect the data that is not on a disk. Azure SQL has been backing
itself up since L1.3 deployed, so this chapter is as much about verifying what
already exists as configuring what does not.

**The IaC lesson:** version-pinned templates are themselves a recovery
mechanism — "redeploy from `main`" is a legitimate strategy for everything no
backup service covers, which is why every module in this repo pins a version.

## What you're building

Almost nothing new is deployed — two retention policies land on the existing
SQL database, and the rest is verification. Point-in-time restore answers
"undo the last few days" and has been running free since L1.3. Long-term
retention answers a compliance question and bills for it. The geo-secondary
from L1.4 answers neither, and proving that is the exercise.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

Two retention mechanisms on the same database, answering different questions.

**Point-in-time restore** answers "undo the last few days". It has been running
since L1.3 deployed, at no extra charge, and the only decision is how far back
the window reaches — the Basic tier this lab uses caps it at seven days.

**Long-term retention** answers "produce the month-end from eighteen months
ago". That is a compliance question rather than an operational one, and its
storage bill scales with how confidently you answer it.

The red box is the trap. The geo-secondary from L1.4 looks like protection and
is not: it replicates a deletion faithfully and immediately. Key Vault appears
because its soft delete and purge protection are already on from L1.3 — this
chapter verifies them rather than re-creating them.

<br>

Container Apps configuration and private DNS records have no backup service —
they are redeployed from `curriculum/L1.3-multi-service-application` instead,
which is a legitimate recovery strategy precisely because the templates are
version-pinned and in git. The lab deploys no storage account, so there is
nothing for a Backup vault to protect. Saying what is *not* covered is part of
a protection review.

**You should see:** `replicationIsNotBackup` stating the trap in one line, and
`whatIsNotProtected` listing the four things in this estate that no backup

Untick **L1.4 is deployed** if you stopped at L1.3; pointing a retention policy at a database that does not exist fails the deployment.

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L4.2-paas-protection/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Then ask the question that decides a real budget:**

> Read `curriculum/L4.2-paas-protection/main.bicep` and tell me what a 7-year yearly retention policy would cost per month for a 50 GB database on RA-GRS storage, showing the arithmetic.

Check the answer against the rate table on the
[Curriculum Cost Model](Curriculum-Cost-Model.md).
Yearly recovery points accumulate rather than replace, so the honest figure
grows every year — which is exactly why the template ships `PT0S` and makes you
ask for it explicitly.

## ✅ Verify it

1. **PITR was already running before you configured anything:**

   ```powershell
   az sql db show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -s $SQL -n "sqldb-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-app" `
     --query "{earliestRestore:earliestRestoreDate}" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** a restore point from days ago — before this chapter ran.
   That is the point: it has been protecting you since L1.3, free and unverified.

2. **Both policies are attached:**

   ```powershell
   az sql db str-policy show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -s $SQL -n "sqldb-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-app" -o table
   az sql db ltr-policy show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -s $SQL -n "sqldb-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-app" -o table
   ```

3. **Prove replication is not backup** — the exercise that justifies the chapter.
   Create a table on the primary, confirm it appears on the geo-secondary, drop
   it, and confirm the drop replicated too. Then restore with PITR:

   ```powershell
   az sql db restore -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -s $SQL -n "sqldb-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-app" `
     --dest-name "sqldb-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-app-restored" --time "<a minute before the drop>"
   ```

   **You should see:** a *new* database containing the table. PITR never restores
   in place — you get a second database and then decide what to do with it, and
   that extra step is the one people forget when writing an RTO.

   **Delete the restored copy afterwards.** It bills like any other database.

4. **Verify Key Vault rather than reconfiguring it:**

   ```powershell
   az keyvault show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n "kv-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-<suffix>" `
     --query "{softDelete:properties.enableSoftDelete, purgeProtection:properties.enablePurgeProtection}" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** both true, from L1.3. Purge protection cannot be turned
   off again once on — a deliberate one-way door, and the same shape of decision
   as L4.1 redundancy.

## ➡️ What carries forward

L4.3 makes all of this operational: the vault reports into the Level 2
workspace, failed *and missing* jobs page someone, and you rehearse a restore
against a written expectation.
