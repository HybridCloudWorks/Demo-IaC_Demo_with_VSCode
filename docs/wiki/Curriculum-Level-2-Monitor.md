# Level 2 — Operations, Monitoring & Observability 🔵

**📍 [Curriculum overview](Curriculum-Redesign.md)** · Level 2 of 6 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [Level 1 · Deploy](Curriculum-Level-1-Deploy.md) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [Level 3 · Secure](Curriculum-Level-3-Secure.md)

**Theme: Monitor.** Turn the environment Level 1 deployed into one you can
actually operate — and learn that in Azure Monitor, *what you collect* is what
you pay for.

**L2.1 is this level's main-path stop** — it stands on L1.1 alone and is all
you need before moving on to Level 3. Chapters L2.2–L2.4 are the level's
depth: go south into them when you want to turn the collected data into
queries, alerts and a governed bill.

| **Builds on** | L1.1 (L2.1 stands on the core alone); deeper chapters need L1.3 |
| **Chapters** | L2.1 · L2.2 · L2.3 · L2.4 |
| **Existing assets reused** | The Log Analytics workspace and Application Insights from L1.3 (when the app tier is deployed); the alert rule pattern already in `curriculum/L1.3-multi-service-application/main.bicep` |
| **New Azure resources** | Almost none — this level is mostly configuration on existing resources |

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

The Level 1 environment feeds into L2.1, which is the collection chapter: data
collection rules and diagnostic settings point every standing resource at one
Log Analytics workspace — a small one L2.1 creates itself on the main path, or
the one L1.3 already created once the app tier is deployed. The remaining
three chapters are the level's depth and run in order, each answering a
different question — L2.2 *what is happening*, L2.3 *what should wake someone
up*, L2.4 *what should we be collecting at all, and what does it cost*.

The dotted line to Level 3 records the design decision that matters most here:
Level 2 produces **one workspace**, and Level 3 puts its security data in that
same workspace rather than creating a second one. That is what makes Sentinel
possible in Level 5 without a redesign.

## L2.1 — Monitoring Fundamentals

**Built:** [`curriculum/L2.1-monitoring-fundamentals`](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/blob/main/curriculum/L2.1-monitoring-fundamentals/main.bicep) ·
**walkthrough:** [L2.1 — Monitoring Fundamentals](Curriculum-L2-1-Monitoring-Fundamentals.md)

**Objective.** Get every resource from Level 1 sending the right telemetry to
one workspace, and be able to say what each stream costs.

**Learning objectives**

- Distinguish platform **metrics** (free, 93-day retention, numeric) from
  **logs** (billed per GB, queryable, arbitrary shape), and pick the right one
  for a given question.
- Configure diagnostic settings on the firewall, load balancer, Key Vault, SQL
  database and container app, and explain what each category actually contains.
- Deploy the Azure Monitor Agent to the Level 1 VMs through a data collection
  rule, and explain why DCRs replaced per-agent configuration.
- Enable VM insights and container insights, and identify which tables they
  write to.
- Read the workspace's own usage table to see what each source is costing.

**Builds on.** L1.1 only — the main-path stop right after Core Deployment; it
creates its own workspace (`log-<prefix>-mon`). Flip `include_web_tier` /
`include_app_tier` to monitor the southern tiers too; the app-tier switch
reuses L1.3's workspace instead.

**Azure services.** Log Analytics workspace (created on the main path, reused from L1.3 with the app tier) · Azure Monitor Agent ·
data collection rules · data collection endpoints · diagnostic settings ·
VM insights · container insights · Azure Activity log.

**Estimated cost.** **+$0.06/hr · running total ~$1.90/hr.** Assumes ~0.5 GB/day
of Analytics-tier ingestion at **$2.76/GB** ≈ $1.38/day. Agents, DCRs and the
Activity log are free; the Activity log is free *only* into Log Analytics.

**Cost optimization.** Turn categories on one at a time and watch the usage
table move. Azure Firewall and NSG flow logs are the two sources that can
quietly dominate this level — collecting them is a deliberate choice, not a
default. Metrics answer many "is it up?" questions for free.

## L2.2 — Operational Visibility

**Built:** [`curriculum/L2.2-operational-visibility`](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/blob/main/curriculum/L2.2-operational-visibility/main.bicep) ·
**walkthrough:** [L2.2 — Operational Visibility](Curriculum-L2-2-Operational-Visibility.md)

**Objective.** Turn collected data into answers, for both the operator and the
person who asks "is the app slow?"

**Learning objectives**

- Write KQL that spans several resource types to answer one operational
  question.
- Build a workbook that shows the health of the whole Level 1 estate on one
  page, parameterised by resource group.
- Use Application Insights on the container app to trace a request through the
  stack and find where latency is.
- Configure availability tests against the Front Door endpoint from L1.4 and
  interpret failures by region.
- Explain the difference between a dashboard someone looks at and a signal
  someone gets paged by — the bridge into L2.3.

**Builds on.** L2.1 (there is nothing to query until collection works).

**Azure services.** Log Analytics (KQL) · Azure Workbooks · Azure Monitor
dashboards · Application Insights (reused from L1.3) · standard availability
tests · Azure Resource Graph.

**Estimated cost.** **+$0.02/hr · running total ~$1.92/hr.** Workbooks,
dashboards, saved searches and queries are free. The cost is ~0.15 GB/day of
Application Insights telemetry (~$0.017/hr) plus the availability test at
**$0.0005 per execution** — $0.004/hr at the two-location, 15-minute cadence the
template ships with. Raise it to the portal default of five locations every five
minutes and that single line becomes $0.03/hr, more than the rest of Level 2
combined.

**Cost optimization.** Application Insights sampling is the lever here — at
default settings a chatty app can out-ingest every other source combined.
Queries themselves are free in the Analytics tier, so exploration is safe; that
stops being true for the Basic and Auxiliary tiers introduced in L2.4.

## L2.3 — Proactive Operations

**Built:** [`curriculum/L2.3-proactive-operations`](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/blob/main/curriculum/L2.3-proactive-operations/main.bicep) ·
**walkthrough:** [L2.3 — Proactive Operations](Curriculum-L2-3-Proactive-Operations.md)

**Objective.** Move from watching to being told — with a signal-to-noise budget.

**Learning objectives**

- Create metric, log and activity-log alert rules and choose correctly between
  them for a given failure mode.
- Route alerts through action groups, and design a notification path that
  survives one person being on holiday.
- Apply dynamic thresholds where a static one would be wrong, and explain when
  they misbehave.
- Read the container app's scale rules where they actually live — in L1.3's
  template, which owns that resource — and explain why a monitoring chapter
  must not reach in and edit them.
- Suppress noise deliberately with alert processing rules during maintenance,
  and defend the decision.

**Builds on.** L2.2 (the queries become the log alerts) and L1.3's existing
`HighReplicaCount` alert, which is the worked example already in the repo.

**Azure services.** Azure Monitor alert rules (metric, log, activity log) ·
action groups · alert processing rules · dynamic thresholds · autoscale ·
Azure Service Health alerts.

**Estimated cost.** **+$0.01/hr · running total ~$1.93/hr.** Metric alerts are
$0.10 per monitored metric/month; log alerts are $1.50/month at 5-minute
frequency, $0.50 at 15-minute; the first 1,000 emails are free and Service
Health alerts cost nothing. A realistic lab set (10 metric + 4 log rules) is
about $7/month.

**Cost optimization.** Alert *frequency* is the price dial: the same log alert
costs three times as much at 1-minute evaluation as at 5-minute. Most lab
signals do not need a 1-minute rule. Metric alerts on platform metrics avoid
ingestion charges entirely.

## L2.4 — Enterprise Monitoring Strategy

**Built:** [`curriculum/L2.4-monitoring-strategy`](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/blob/main/curriculum/L2.4-monitoring-strategy/main.bicep) ·
**walkthrough:** [L2.4 — Enterprise Monitoring Strategy](Curriculum-L2-4-Monitoring-Strategy.md)

**Objective.** Decide what a hundred of these environments would collect, and
prove the decision with numbers.

**Learning objectives**

- Choose a workspace topology (single vs. per-team vs. per-region) and justify
  it against access control, data sovereignty and cost.
- Place each table in the right plan — **Analytics**, **Basic** or **Auxiliary**
  — and quantify the saving and the capability lost.
- Separate interactive retention from long-term retention and archive, and
  compute the cost of a 12-month compliance requirement.
- Report on missing diagnostic settings estate-wide with an Azure Policy
  `AuditIfNotExists` assignment, and explain why the auto-remediating
  `DeployIfNotExists` variant is unavailable to a Contributor — it needs a role
  assignment, which is the boundary between running a workload and governing a
  platform.
- Build a monitoring cost report and set a budget with an action group on it.

**Builds on.** L2.1–L2.3 — this chapter governs everything the previous three
turned on.

**Azure services.** Log Analytics table plans · retention and archive settings ·
Azure Policy (`DeployIfNotExists`) · Azure Monitor commitment tiers ·
Microsoft Cost Management budgets · Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts patterns.

**Estimated cost.** **+$0.01/hr gross, −$0.03/hr net · running total ~$1.91/hr.**
Retaining 30 GB past the included 31 days costs $0.12/GB/month (~$3.60/month);
archive is $0.02/GB/month. Against that, moving ~0.3 GB/day of verbose logs from
Analytics ($2.76/GB) to Basic ($0.50/GB) saves about $0.68/day.

**Cost optimization.** This chapter is *the* optimization chapter: it should end
with a lower bill than it started. Commitment tiers start at 100 GB/day and are
far above lab volume — worth explaining, not enabling. The transferable lesson
is that in Azure Monitor, architecture decisions and cost decisions are the same
decision.

## Cost summary for Level 2

| Chapter | Adds | Running total | Dominant meter |
|---|---|---|---|
| L2.1 Monitoring Fundamentals | +$0.06/hr | ~$1.90/hr | Analytics ingestion $2.76/GB |
| L2.2 Operational Visibility | +$0.02/hr | ~$1.92/hr | App Insights telemetry |
| L2.3 Proactive Operations | +$0.01/hr | ~$1.93/hr | Log alert rules ($1.50/rule/mo at 5 min) |
| L2.4 Enterprise Monitoring Strategy | −$0.02/hr net | ~$1.91/hr | Retention vs. Basic-tier saving |

**Level 2 adds roughly $0.07/hr — about 4% of the running bill.** Said plainly:
instrumenting this environment properly costs less than 6% of what its firewall
costs. That comparison belongs in the level's closing slide.

> [!TIP]
> Level 2's cost is entirely a function of GB/day. Before the level starts, note
> the current usage; after L2.4, note it again. The delta *is* the lesson.

> <img src="icon-spotlight.svg" width="16" align="top"> **GitHub feature spotlight · Repository variables for lab settings**
>
> **Why it matters here:** every alert in this level needs a destination, and
> every workspace query needs a resource group. The workflow derives both from
> the fork owner — the resource group *is* your account name, and the prefix is
> its first segment lowercased — so no repository variables are needed and
> monitoring configuration never hardcodes an environment. Repository
> variables (`AZURE_PREFIX`, `ALERT_EMAIL`) exist only as overrides.
> **Find it:** the `env:` block in `.github/workflows/curriculum-l2-operations.yml`.
> **Beyond the lab:** the same split — non-secret configuration as variables,
> credentials as OIDC — is what lets one monitoring template serve dev, test and
> production.

## What carries forward

Level 3 puts Microsoft Defender for Cloud on top of this estate and sends its
findings to **this workspace**. The alert routing built in L2.3 becomes the
delivery path for security alerts, and the table-plan discipline from L2.4 is
what keeps Level 5's Sentinel bill sane.
