# L1.3 — Multi-Service Application Architecture 🟠

**📍 [Level 1 · Deploy](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/wiki/Curriculum-Level-1-Deploy)** · Chapter 3 of 4 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [L1.2 — Architecture Expansion](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/wiki/Curriculum-L1-2-Architecture-Expansion) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [L1.4 — Production-Ready Platform](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/wiki/Curriculum-L1-4-Production-Platform)

**Goal:** modernize the app tier — Azure Container Apps instead of VMs, an Azure SQL backend, Key Vault and a managed identity for secrets, and Log Analytics / Application Insights monitoring with an email alert. This is where **private networking** arrives: SQL and Key Vault have public access **disabled** and are reachable only through private endpoints.

| Who this is for | Time | You need first | Cost while it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab 3 of 4 · everyone | ~20 min | L1.1 deployed. **L1.2 is not required.** | 🟠 ~$1.73/hr running total |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **L1.1 must already be deployed** — L1.3 peers a new spoke to L1.1's hub. It also uses a SQL admin password, and that's automatic: the `SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` secret on your fork, or a random one generated for the run when that secret is not set. Set the secret before L1.3 if you want L1.4's second server to share the same password. (Self-hosted: the `SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in `lab-settings.csv` back in L1.1.)

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

L1.3 creates a **second spoke** — `vnet-iacdemo-spoke2` (`10.2.0.0/16`) — and
peers it to L1.1's hub. It does not reuse L1.1's spoke, and it does not route
through L1.2's firewall: this stack branches off the hub on its own. L1.2 is not a
prerequisite.

The spoke holds two subnets. `snet-aca` (`10.2.0.0/23`) is delegated to
`Microsoft.App/environments` and runs the Container Apps environment and the
web app. `snet-private-endpoints` (`10.2.2.0/24`) holds one private endpoint
for SQL and one for Key Vault.

Both data services have **public network access disabled**, so a connection
from your laptop fails. The app reaches them over private endpoints using its
managed identity. The private DNS zones are what make that work — they resolve
the `privatelink` hostnames to private addresses, and they are linked to
**spoke2 only**, so the name resolves privately from inside that VNet and
nowhere else.

One thing worth being explicit about: the container app itself is **publicly
reachable** (`ingressExternal: true`). "Private networking" here applies to the
data tier, not the front door.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why a second spoke instead of reusing L1.1's?** Because these workloads have different needs. The Container Apps environment requires a subnet **delegated** to `Microsoft.App/environments` — Azure hands that subnet over and you can't put anything else in it — and the private endpoints want their own space. Giving L1.3 its own spoke off the same hub is the standard pattern: shared services in the hub, each workload in its own spoke, none of them entangled.
>
> It also means L1.3 doesn't depend on L2. If you tore the firewall down to save money, this lab still works.

## 🚀 Deploy it — pick any one of three ways

All three deploy the **same** template and give the **same** result.

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center" width="240"><img src="bicep.png" width="70"><br><br><b>1 · Bicep CLI</b><br><sub>Copy-paste in the terminal</sub></td>
<td align="center" width="240"><img src="gh-actions.png" width="70"><br><br><b>2 · GitHub Actions</b><br><sub>One button in the browser</sub></td>

> [!NOTE]
> **🏫 Classroom: use Option 2 (GitHub Actions).** Your Azure account holds Reader, so the local `az deployment` commands in Options 1 and 3 will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the shared workshop identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## <img src="bicep.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 1 · Bicep from the terminal

**Best if you like the command line** (self-hosted only). Your values are already loaded from `lab-settings.csv` (set up in L1.1) — nothing to re-type.

```powershell
az deployment group what-if --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L1.3-multi-service-application/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create  --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L1.3-multi-service-application/main.bicepparam
```

**You should see:** an `appUrl` output ending in `.azurecontainerapps.io`. The alert email goes to whatever you put in the `ALERT_EMAIL` column.

<br>

---

## <img src="gh-actions.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 2 · GitHub Actions (push-button)

**Best if you'd rather click a button.** Classroom forks are pre-wired — nothing to set up; self-hosted needs the one-time `Setup-Oidc.ps1` ([Deployment Guide](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/wiki/Deployment-Guide)).

On GitHub: **Actions → "Curriculum L1.3 - Multi-Service Application" → Run workflow** (or `gh workflow run curriculum-l1-3-multi-service-application.yml`).

**You should see:** **Lint → What-if → Deploy**, then a final step printing the app URL.

<br>

---

## <img src="gh-copilot.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 3 · GitHub Copilot (plain English)

**Best if you'd rather describe the change** and have AI edit and deploy it. The deploy step is self-hosted only (classroom accounts hold Reader).

Copilot runs the deploy **locally**, so (self-hosted) load your values once first (same file as Option 1): `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`.

Open **Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L1.3-multi-service-application/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Want to scale it first?** Ask:

> In `curriculum/L1.3-multi-service-application/main.bicep`, raise `maxReplicas` to 5 and add an env var `GREETING=Hello L1.3` to the container, run `az bicep build`, then deploy.

Copilot edits, verifies, and deploys — and fixes any error you paste back.

## ✅ Verify it

1. **The app is up** — open the `appUrl` from the deploy output, or fetch it:

   ```powershell
   az containerapp show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n "ca-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-web" `
     --query "properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn" -o tsv
   ```

   **You should see:** the Container Apps quickstart page. Note that this front end is deliberately **public** — the private networking in this lab protects the data tier, not the app.

2. **SQL is unreachable from outside** — from your machine:

   ```powershell
   $SQL = az sql server list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     --query "[?starts_with(name, 'sql-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-')].name | [0]" -o tsv
   nslookup "$SQL.database.windows.net"
   ```

   **You should see:** the name resolve to a **public** address, and any connection attempt refused — public network access is disabled. Resolution working while connection fails is the expected split.

3. **The same name resolves privately from inside the spoke** — this is the half that proves private endpoints work, and it has to run *inside* the VNet, because the private DNS zones are linked to `spoke2` only:

   ```powershell
   az containerapp exec -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n "ca-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-web" `
     --command "getent hosts $SQL.database.windows.net"
   ```

   **You should see:** a **`10.2.2.x`** address — inside `snet-private-endpoints`. Same hostname, different answer depending on where you ask. That is exactly what a private endpoint plus a private DNS zone does, and why running this from L1.1's Bastion VM would fail: it sits in a different VNet with no link to those zones.

4. **Monitoring fires** — scale up and wait for the alert:

   ```powershell
   az containerapp update -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n "ca-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-web" --min-replicas 2
   ```

   **You should see:** a `HighReplicaCount` email at your `ALERT_EMAIL` within about 15 minutes — the rule evaluates over a 15-minute window. Scale back down afterwards with `--min-replicas 1` so you stop paying for the second replica.

> <img src="icon-spotlight.svg" width="16" align="top"> **GitHub feature spotlight · OIDC federated credentials**
>
> **You just used it:** if you deployed with Option 2, GitHub deployed private networking into your Azure subscription and **there is no cloud password stored anywhere** — not in the repo, not in a secret, not on your machine. The workflow asked GitHub for a signed token describing itself, and Entra ID traded it for a short-lived Azure token.
> **Find it:** **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** on your fork — and find **no Azure credential**. At most there are the three IDs that name the deploy identity (they unlock nothing on their own) and any VM or SQL password you chose. What actually grants access is the federated trust between GitHub and Entra ID itself — which is a relationship, not a value anyone could read or leak. The missing password *is* the lesson.
> **Beyond the lab:** this is the modern answer to the oldest problem in CI. Nothing to leak, nothing to rotate, and a fork can't use it — its token names a different repository, so the subject check fails.

## ➡️ What carries forward

L1.4 treats everything you just built as the **primary region**. It adds a second-region copy of the app, joins your SQL database to a failover group, and puts Azure Front Door in front of both — then asks whether the result would actually survive an outage.
