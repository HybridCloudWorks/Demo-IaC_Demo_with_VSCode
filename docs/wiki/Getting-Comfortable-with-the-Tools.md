# Getting Comfortable with the Tools

> [!NOTE]
> A 15-minute hands-on warm-up. **Nothing here deploys anything to Azure.** Work through it in order in your clone of the repo, and by the end every tool will feel familiar.

## Which machine are you on?

This workshop is built for **Windows 11**. Install commands live on the [Start-Here Checklist](Start-Here-Checklist.md).

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center" width="360"><img src="icon-windows.svg" width="56"><br><br><b>Windows 11</b><br><sub>Supported — one winget command per tool, or the installer script</sub></td>
<td align="center" width="360"><img src="icon-macos-linux.svg" width="56"><br><br><b>macOS or Linux</b><br><sub>Not supported today — see below</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **macOS and Linux are not supported today.** Two hard dependencies, not preferences:
> - `Install-LabTools.ps1` installs the whole toolchain with **`winget`**, which is Windows-only.
> - `Load-LabSettings.ps1 -Persist` writes to the **Windows user environment store**. .NET has no equivalent elsewhere, so on macOS and Linux that flag silently saves nothing.
>
> The rest of the workshop is genuinely platform-agnostic — the Bicep templates, the GitHub Actions workflows, and Azure do not care what you are typing on. It is the **on-ramp** that is Windows-bound. Making it portable is a known future improvement, not a supported path today.

## 1. 🧑‍💻 VS Code — 5 minutes

The editor is your home base for the whole workshop.

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Open the repo | `File → Open Folder` → pick your clone |
| Command Palette | `Ctrl+Shift+P` — search for anything |
| Integrated terminal | `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick) |
| Source control (stage/commit/push) | Branch icon in the left rail, or `Ctrl+Shift+G` |
| Accept recommended extensions | Pop-up on first open, or Extensions view → **Recommended** |

**Try it:** open the terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``), run `az bicep version`, then open `curriculum/L1.1-core-deployment/main.bicep` and hover over `br/public:avm/res/network/virtual-network:0.9.0`. The Bicep extension shows the module's parameters inline.

## 2. 🧱 Bicep — 5 minutes

Bicep is the language you use to describe Azure infrastructure. You do not need to write much from scratch — Copilot and AVM do the heavy lifting — but you need to be able to *read* it.

A minimal Bicep file:

```bicep
// A parameter (an input) with a default value
param location string = 'eastus2'

// A module: reuse a pre-built Azure Verified Module, version-pinned
module vnet 'br/public:avm/res/network/virtual-network:0.9.0' = {
  name: 'my-vnet'
  params: {
    name:            'vnet-demo'
    location:        location
    addressPrefixes: ['10.0.0.0/16']
  }
}

// An output (a value readable after deploy — e.g. the URL or resource ID)
output vnetId string = vnet.outputs.resourceId
```

Three things to recognise:

- **`param`** — inputs, usually supplied by the `.bicepparam` file alongside the template.
- **`module 'br/public:avm/...'`** — an [Azure Verified Module](https://aka.ms/avm). The `:0.9.0` is a **pinned version** — the same version produces the same result every deploy.
- **`output`** — values surfaced after deploy (the workflows print these: app URL, firewall IP, etc.).

**Try it — compile without deploying:**

```powershell
az bicep build --file curriculum/L1.1-core-deployment/main.bicep --stdout | Select-Object -First 20
```

If it prints JSON, it compiled. That ARM JSON is what Azure actually receives — you write Bicep, Azure gets JSON.

## 3. 🤖 GitHub Copilot — agent mode — 5 minutes

Copilot **agent mode** is the star of the workshop. Unlike plain autocomplete, agent mode reads across multiple files, edits several at once, and runs terminal commands (like `az bicep build`) — pausing for your approval before each action.

**Set up:**

1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+I` to open Copilot Chat.
2. Change the mode dropdown (top of the chat panel) from **Ask** to **Agent**.
3. Confirm you are signed in (bottom-left account icon in VS Code).

**How to write good prompts:**

- **Name the file:** *"In `curriculum/L1.1-core-deployment/main.bicep`, add a subnet…"* — pointing at a specific file focuses Copilot.
- **Ask it to verify itself:** *"…then run `az bicep build` on the file and fix any errors."*
- **Review every diff.** Agent mode proposes changes; you decide. Accept, tweak, or reject. Never merge without reading.

**Try it (safe — fully reversible):**

> In `curriculum/L1.1-core-deployment/main.bicep`, add a second subnet named `snet-data` with address prefix `10.1.2.0/24` to the spoke VNet, then run `az bicep build` to verify it compiles.

Read the diff it proposes. Then discard it — Source Control → discard changes. L1.1 works fine without this change.

> [!TIP]
> **Copilot etiquette for IaC:** if it suggests raw ARM resources or old API versions, say: *"Use the pinned AVM module versions already present in this repo."* Consistency matters.

## You are warmed up

You can open the repo, read Bicep, compile a template, and drive Copilot. That is everything the labs assume.

→ Head to the [Start-Here Checklist](Start-Here-Checklist.md) to finish setup, then [L1.1 — Core Deployment](Curriculum-L1-1-Core-Deployment.md).

For install links and deeper CLI reference, see [Tools and References](Tools-and-References.md).

> **You just used it:** when you opened this folder, VS Code offered you the Bicep and Copilot extensions. That was not your settings — the **repository** asked for them.
> **Find it:** [`.vscode/extensions.json`](https://github.com/HybridCloudWorks/Demo-IaC_Demo_with_VSCode/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json). Five recommendations, checked into git.
> **Beyond the lab:** new joiners get the right toolchain on first open, with nothing to read and nothing to install by hand. One small file removes an entire onboarding step.
