**Goal:** build a real regional recovery capability for the tier you cannot
simply redeploy — the stateful one. Every other tier gets matched to the
mechanism that actually fits it.

**The IaC lesson:** knowing what does *not* belong in a template — replication
policy and fabrics are declarative metadata that live in Bicep, while enabling
replication is a long-running, billed operation that deserves to be a command
somebody types.

<br>

| Who this is for | Time | You need first | Cost while it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chapter 2 of Level 6 · everyone | ~20 min | **L4.1** (the vault) and **L6.1** | 🟢 **$0.00/hr as deployed** · $25/VM/month once you enable replication |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This template lays the groundwork but does not enable replication.**
> Replication seeds an initial copy over hours and starts a **$25/VM/month**
> meter the moment it succeeds — that step stays a deliberate manual command.

<br>

## What you're building

Four tiers, four different recovery mechanisms — and only the stateful VMs
need a new product. The template deploys a Site Recovery replication policy
and a fabric in each region; SQL and the traffic layer reuse what L1.4 already
built, and the stateless container app's plan is redeploy-from-git. The one
paid step — enabling replication — is left deliberately manual.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

Four tiers, four different answers, and only one of them needs Site Recovery.

The **VMs** are stateful and cannot be recreated from a template with their data
intact, so they get ASR: a replication policy that takes crash-consistent points
every five minutes and app-consistent ones every four hours, plus a fabric at
each end. Policy and fabrics are free — they are metadata.

The **database** already has its answer from L1.4: a failover group. The
**traffic layer** likewise, through Front Door health probes and origin
priority. Neither needs anything new here, which is worth pausing on: two of the
four DR mechanisms in this architecture were built in Level 1 without being
called DR.

The **container app** is stateless, so its recovery mechanism is *redeploy from
this repository* — costing **$0/month** in standby, against paying for warm
infrastructure that does nothing on a normal day.

The red box is the manual step, and the meter.

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — why replication is not in the template</b></summary>

<br>

Leaving replication out is not a shortcut. Enabling replication is a
long-running, stateful operation that seeds an initial copy over hours and does
not converge inside a deployment — and it starts a **$25/VM/month** meter the
moment it succeeds. That deserves to be a command somebody types, not a side
effect of a redeploy.

</details>

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — recovery plan order is not a detail</b></summary>

<br>

Data before app, app before traffic. Failing traffic over to a region whose
database has not finished failing over produces a working site serving wrong
answers — which is worse than an outage, because nobody notices. Write the
sequence down before the drill in L6.3.

> [!NOTE]
> **🏫 Classroom: use the GitHub Actions option.** Your Azure account holds Reader, so local `az deployment` commands will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the shared workshop identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## <img src="bicep.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 1 · Bicep from the terminal

```powershell
az deployment group what-if --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L6.2-disaster-recovery/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create  --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L6.2-disaster-recovery/main.bicepparam
```

**You should see:** `rpoShape` stating the RPO in plain terms,
`whatIsStillManual` explaining the missing step, and `cheaperAlternative` making
the case for redeploying the stateless tiers instead.

**Then enable replication for ONE VM, by hand:**

```powershell
az site-recovery protection-container mapping create --help   # read this first — the flags are unforgiving
```

One VM teaches the mechanism. Four teaches the same thing at four times the
price.

## <img src="gh-actions.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 2 · GitHub Actions (push-button)

**Actions → "Curriculum L6 - Disaster Recovery & Redundancy" → Run workflow →
L6.2 - Disaster Recovery Implementation**.

The **Recovery region** input defaults to `westus2`, matching the L1.4 secondary so the DR story stays consistent across the curriculum.

<br>

## <img src="gh-copilot.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 3 · GitHub Copilot (plain English)

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L6.2-disaster-recovery/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Then ask for the thing that will not work:**

> Add a resource to `curriculum/L6.2-disaster-recovery/main.bicep` that enables replication for vm-iacdemo-test.

Copilot will produce a `replicationProtectedItems` resource that looks
reasonable. Deploy it and the operation either times out or leaves the item in
a permanent "enabling" state, because initial replication seeds over hours and
the deployment gives up long before. Not every Azure operation belongs in a
template, and knowing which is a senior skill.

<br>

## ✅ Verify it

1. **The policy and both fabrics exist:**

   ```powershell
   az site-recovery policy list --vault-name "rsv-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-backup" -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -o table
   az site-recovery fabric list --vault-name "rsv-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-backup" -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** one policy, two fabrics, and **no protected items** —
   which is correct at this stage, not a failure.

2. **Enable replication for one VM** through the portal (**Recovery Services
   vault → Site Recovery → Enable replication**) and watch the initial seed. It
   takes a while, and watching it is part of understanding what an RPO costs.

3. **Test the mechanisms you already had.** The SQL failover group from L1.4 is
   a DR capability nobody called DR:

   The group name ends in a `uniqueString` suffix you cannot type, so look it up
   rather than guessing:

   ```powershell
   $FOG = az sql failover-group list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -s $SQL --query "[0].name" -o tsv
   az sql failover-group show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -s $SQL -n $FOG `
     --query "{name:name, role:replicationRole, grace:readWriteEndpoint.failoverWithDataLossGracePeriodMinutes}" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** the primary role and the grace period. That grace period
   *is* your RPO for the data tier, and most people have never looked at it.

4. **Price the whole plan.** One replicated VM is $25/month plus replica disks,
   cache storage and egress. Four is $100/month plus the rest. The stateless
   tiers are $0. Write the number down — L6.3 asks whether the RTO it buys is
   the one the business asked for.

## ➡️ What carries forward

L6.3 proves all of it. RTO and RPO derived from a requirement, drills that
produce numbers, and an SLO alert that fires when the promise is not being
kept.
