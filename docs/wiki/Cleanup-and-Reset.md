# Cleanup & Reset

Two different cleanups, and they are not interchangeable. One stops Azure charging you. The other takes the lab off your laptop.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Order matters.** Tear down Azure **first**, then clear credentials. Once you are signed out you can no longer delete anything — and Azure Firewall, Bastion, Front Door and SQL keep billing at roughly **$1.84/hr** with the full stack up.

| | What it removes | How |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · Azure** | Everything the labs deployed | Classroom: the **Teardown labs** workflow · Self-hosted: `Cleanup-Labs.ps1` |
| **2 · This machine** | `az` and `gh` sign-ins, saved settings, your passwords file | `Clear-LabCredentials.ps1` *(self-hosted / CLI path)* |

---

## 1. Tear down Azure

### Classroom — the Teardown workflow

On your fork: **Actions → Teardown labs → Run workflow**. It **defaults to a dry run** that only lists what would be deleted; to delete for real, un-check *dry run* and type `DELETE` into the confirmation input.

That workflow is your teardown path, full stop: your account holds **Reader** on the resource group, so `Cleanup-Labs.ps1` (which deletes resources directly with your own credentials) cannot work for you — it is a self-hosted tool. The workflow deletes under your workshop deploy identity instead, targeting the group named after your fork owner. The group itself always stays.

### Self-hosted — the script

Preview first — it lists what would go and changes nothing:

```powershell
./scripts/Cleanup-Labs.ps1 -ResourceGroup $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -WhatIf
./scripts/Cleanup-Labs.ps1 -ResourceGroup $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP
```

**You should see:** the resources deleted in three passes, then a report of anything that survived. It deletes the *contents* of the group and leaves the group itself. (The Teardown workflow works for self-hosted forks too.)

Also removing the Entra app registration your own setup created:

```powershell
./scripts/Cleanup-Labs.ps1 -Prefix "<yourname>" -RemoveOidc
```

> [!WARNING]
> **`-RemoveOidc` is for self-hosted setups only — in the classroom, removing the Entra app is instructor-only.** The classroom deploy identity is not an app registration: it is a managed identity in the instructor's environment, removed by the instructor's teardown after class. Instructors: see [Instructor Admin Tools](Instructor-Admin-Tools.md).

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not delete only the Azure Firewall.** After L1.2, both spoke subnets route `0.0.0.0/0` at its private IP. Removing it alone black-holes every VM's outbound traffic while they keep billing. Tear down all of L1.2, route table included, or run the full teardown.

---

## 2. Clear this machine

Skip this on a classroom laptop that gets reimaged. **Do it if you ran the labs on your own machine.**

```powershell
./scripts/Clear-LabCredentials.ps1 -WhatIf   # preview
./scripts/Clear-LabCredentials.ps1
```

It checks for still-deployed resources before signing you out, and stops to ask if it finds any.

### What the labs put on your machine

| Left behind | Where | Removed by |
|---|---|---|
| Azure sign-in token | `~/.azure` token cache | `Clear-LabCredentials.ps1` |
| GitHub sign-in token | `gh` config (`hosts.yml`) | `Clear-LabCredentials.ps1` |
| Your prefix, region, resource group | User environment variables *(Windows)* | `Clear-LabCredentials.ps1`, or `Load-LabSettings.ps1 -Clear` |
| **VM and SQL passwords** | User environment variables *(Windows)*, and `lab-settings.csv` | Both of the above |
| GitHub Desktop / VS Code sign-in | Each app's own store | **You** — sign out in the app |

Only clearing the saved settings, staying signed in:

```powershell
./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1 -Clear
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`-Persist` writes your lab passwords to disk in plain text.** On Windows they go to the registry under `HKCU\Environment` and stay until removed. That is a deliberate convenience for a throwaway lab, not a habit to carry to work — real credentials belong in a secret store, which is exactly what the OIDC path in these labs demonstrates.
>
> This workshop is **Windows 11 only**. On macOS or Linux `-Persist` does nothing at all — only Windows has a user environment store for it to write to — so there is nothing stored to clean up there either. The script says so rather than pretending. `lab-settings.csv` is the persistence in that case: re-run `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1` per terminal.

## Useful commands

**Where am I signed in?**

```powershell
az account show --query "{subscription:name, user:user.name}" -o table
gh auth status
```

**What is still deployed, and what is it costing?**

```powershell
az resource list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --query "[].{name:name, type:type}" -o table
az resource list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --query "length(@)"
```

**Reload settings in a new terminal**

```powershell
./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1
```

**Why did a deployment fail?**

```powershell
$RG = $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP
az deployment group list -g $RG --query "[?properties.provisioningState=='Failed'].[name]" -o tsv
az deployment group show -g $RG --name <deployment-name> --query properties.error
```

**Start the whole workshop over**

*Classroom:* run the **Teardown labs** workflow (dry run → `DELETE`), then simply run L1.1 again. There is nothing to re-run or re-wire — the deploy identity lives in the workflow code and the federated trust, not in your fork.

*Self-hosted:* teardown, then re-run setup:

```powershell
./scripts/Cleanup-Labs.ps1 -ResourceGroup $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP
./scripts/Setup-Oidc.ps1 -ResourceGroup $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -Prefix "<yourname>"
```
