# L2.3 — Proactive Operations 🔵

**Goal:** stop having to look. Six alert rules watch the estate — CPU, database,
firewall, dead VMs, error spikes and Azure itself — and mail one inbox when
something needs a human.

**The IaC lesson:** alert rules are resources. Thresholds, evaluation windows
and inboxes all live in the template — reviewed, versioned and identical for
every classroom — not in portal clicks nobody can audit.

| Who this is for | Time | You need first | Cost while it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chapter 3 of Level 2 · everyone | ~20 min | **L2.1** and **L2.2** | 🔵 ~$0.01/hr added · ~$1.93/hr running total |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This chapter creates its **own** action group. It does not edit the one L1.3
> created — two templates owning one resource means whichever deployed last
> wins. Adding a resource is cheap; sharing ownership is not.

<br>

## What you're building

Three kinds of signal feed six rules, and every rule notifies the same action
group. A processing rule silences the lot during the nightly maintenance
window.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

Three signal sources feed six rules, which all notify one action group.

**Platform metrics** — free, already collected — drive three metric alerts:
CPU above 80% across every VM as one multi-resource rule, a dynamic-threshold
rule on SQL DTU, and SNAT port utilisation on the firewall.

**Log data from L2.1** drives two scheduled query rules. These catch what
metrics structurally cannot: a VM that stopped reporting emits no metric to
threshold, so only a query over `Heartbeat` can notice its absence.

**Service Health** drives a free activity-log alert — the only rule here that
fires for something you cannot fix, which is exactly why you want it before
you spend an hour debugging your own template.

Everything notifies `ag-iacdemo-oncall`. The dotted line is the alert
processing rule: between 02:00 and 03:00 UTC it strips the action groups off
every alert in the resource group, so maintenance does not page anyone.

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — where is autoscale?</b></summary>

<br>

The learning objective is real, but this estate has nowhere honest to put it.
Azure Monitor autoscale targets virtual machine scale sets and App Service
plans; the only elastic thing here is the container app, and its scale rules
live inside `curriculum/L1.3-multi-service-application/main.bicep` — the
template that owns it. Adding them from this chapter would recreate exactly
the shared-ownership problem the callout above warns about. Read the scale
block in L1.3's template instead, and change it there.

> [!NOTE]
> **🏫 Classroom: use the GitHub Actions option.** Your Azure account holds Reader, so local `az deployment` commands will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the workshop deploy identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## 🚀 Deploy it — pick any one of three ways

```powershell
az deployment group what-if --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L2.3-proactive-operations/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create  --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L2.3-proactive-operations/main.bicepparam
```

**You should see:** `metricAlertCount` 3, `logAlertCount` 2, and a
`monthlyAlertCostBasis` string spelling out what you just signed up for.

**Want a second inbox?** Set it before deploying:

```powershell
$env:ALERT_EMAIL_SECONDARY = "someone.else@example.com"
```

**Actions → "Curriculum L2 - Operations & Monitoring" → Run workflow →
L2.3 - Proactive Operations**.

The addresses come from repository variables `ALERT_EMAIL` and
`ALERT_EMAIL_SECONDARY` — the first is the same one the L1.3 lab already uses,
so a class that set it once does not set it again.

## <img src="gh-copilot.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 3 · GitHub Copilot (plain English)

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L2.3-proactive-operations/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Turn one of L2.2's saved queries into a rule:**

> In `curriculum/L2.3-proactive-operations/main.bicep`, add a scheduled query rule that fires when the firewall denies more than 50 flows in 15 minutes, using the same query as the `firewall-verdicts` saved search in L2.2. Keep the evaluation frequency at PT15M. Run `az bicep build`, then show me a what-if.

Notice what you had to decide: a threshold, a window, and whether it is worth
$0.50 a month. Every one of those is a judgement, not a lookup.

<br>

---

## ✅ Verify it

1. **The rules exist and are enabled:**

   ```powershell
   az monitor metrics alert list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -o table
   az monitor scheduled-query list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** three metric rules (two if you skipped L1.2) and two
   scheduled query rules.

2. **Make one fire** — load a VM through Bastion and wait for the window:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y stress-ng && stress-ng --cpu 2 --timeout 900s
   ```

   **You should see:** the CPU rule move to *Fired* within about 15 minutes,
   and mail at your alert address. The rule averages over 15 minutes on
   purpose — a one-minute spike is not an incident.

3. **Prove the log alert catches what metrics cannot** — stop a VM entirely:

   ```powershell
   az vm deallocate -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n "vm-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-web2"
   ```

   **You should see:** *A VM stopped reporting* fire within about 15 minutes.
   The CPU metric rule stays silent throughout — a VM that is gone emits no
   metric to threshold. That difference is the whole reason both rule types
   exist. Start it again with `az vm start` afterwards.

4. **Check the suppression window is real:**

   ```powershell
   az monitor alert-processing-rule list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** `apr-<prefix>-maintenance-window`, enabled, 02:00–03:00
   UTC. Worth saying out loud: during that hour, genuine alerts are swallowed
   too. Suppression is a governance decision, not a convenience.

5. **What it costs:** metric alerts bill $0.10 per monitored metric per month;
   log alerts are $0.50 each at 15-minute evaluation. The set above is about
   **$2.30/month**. Service Health and the processing rule are free.

## ➡️ What carries forward

L2.4 asks the governing question: which of these rules would you keep if you
ran a hundred of these environments, and what would you stop collecting? It is
the first chapter in the curriculum designed to *reduce* the bill.
