# L2.4 — Enterprise Monitoring Strategy 🔵

**📍 [Level 2 · Monitor](Curriculum-Level-2-Monitor.md)** · Chapter 4 of 4 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [L2.3 — Proactive Operations](Curriculum-L2-3-Proactive-Operations.md) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [Level 3 · Secure](Curriculum-Level-3-Secure.md)

**Goal:** decide what a hundred of these environments would collect, and prove
the decision with numbers. This is the only chapter in the curriculum that
should **end with a smaller bill than it started**.

**The IaC lesson:** cost decisions as code. A table-plan change lands as a
diff with the reasoning written next to the setting — so six months from now,
"why is Syslog still on the expensive plan?" is answered by `git log`, not by
someone's memory.

## What you're building

High-volume tables move to the cheaper Basic plan, the long tail moves to
archive, a policy audits what everyone forgot, and a budget puts a number on
the whole thing.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

Three tables, treated differently on purpose.

`AZFWApplicationRule` — the highest-volume table L2.1 turned on — moves to the
**Basic** plan at $0.50/GB instead of $2.76/GB, an 82% cut on that table. It
can move because nothing queries it interactively: it is evidence, not signal.

`Syslog` and `Heartbeat` **stay on Analytics**, and that is not an oversight.
L2.3's alert rules query both, and alert rules cannot read Basic tables.
Moving `Syslog` would save $2.26/GB and silently break a rule someone relies
on — the trap this chapter exists to teach.

Both retained tables get 180-day total retention, so data past the included
31 days falls into the archive at $0.02/GB/month instead of $0.12.

Alongside the tables, an **AuditIfNotExists** policy reports which resources
have no diagnostic setting at all, and a **budget** with two actual thresholds
and one forecast threshold notifies the action group L2.3 built.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The policy assignment is off by default, and that is the lesson.** Plain
> Contributor — what the shared workshop deploy identity holds (students
> themselves hold **Reader**) — cannot create a policy assignment. Turn it on
> with `CURRICULUM_ASSIGN_POLICY=true` only if you hold **Resource Policy
> Contributor** or **Owner**. The full story is in *Going deeper* below.

<br>

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — why Contributor can't assign policy</b></summary>

<br>

Contributor's `notActions` include `Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write`, which
covers policy assignments as well as role assignments. Classroom participants
hold **Reader**; only the shared workshop deploy identity holds plain
Contributor on each resource group — so leaving the assignment on would fail
the deploy for everyone it was written
for. Your instructor already has the same job covered by
`scripts/admin/Set-LabPolicy.ps1`.

It is `AuditIfNotExists` rather than `DeployIfNotExists` for a second reason:
DINE also needs a managed identity, and giving that identity permissions needs
a role assignment — the same wall.

None of this is a lab limitation to apologise for. It is the actual boundary
between "team that runs a workload" and "team that governs a platform", and
it is worth ten minutes of discussion.

> [!NOTE]
> **🏫 Classroom: use the GitHub Actions option.** Your Azure account holds Reader, so local `az deployment` commands will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the shared workshop identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## 🚀 Deploy it — pick any one of three ways

```powershell
az deployment group what-if --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L2.4-monitoring-strategy/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create  --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L2.4-monitoring-strategy/main.bicepparam
```

**You should see:** `basicPlanTable` naming the table that moved, and
`tablesLeftOnAnalytics` naming the two that did not — with `whyTablesStayed`
explaining it, so the answer survives being read six months later.

**Set a budget you would actually notice:**

```powershell
$env:CURRICULUM_MONTHLY_BUDGET = "200"
```

A budget above anything you would ever spend never fires, which is the same
as not having one.

**Actions → "Curriculum L2 - Operations & Monitoring" → Run workflow →
L2.4 - Enterprise Monitoring Strategy**.

Worth running with **Stop after what-if** ticked first: a table plan change is
one of the few edits in this curriculum that is awkward to reverse.

<br>

## <img src="gh-copilot.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 3 · GitHub Copilot (plain English)

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L2.4-monitoring-strategy/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Then argue with it:**

> In `curriculum/L2.4-monitoring-strategy/main.bicep`, move the Syslog table to the Basic plan as well.

Copilot will happily do it. **Do not deploy that.** Go and check which L2.3
rule breaks, then say so in the chat. Knowing when to reject a correct-looking
change is the actual skill this chapter is teaching.

<br>

## ✅ Verify it

1. **The plan actually changed:**

   ```powershell
   az monitor log-analytics workspace table show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     --workspace-name "log-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-l3" -n AZFWApplicationRule `
     --query "{plan:plan, retention:retentionInDays, total:totalRetentionInDays}" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** `Basic`, retention 30 (fixed — Basic ignores what you
   ask for), total 180.

2. **Prove the trade-off is real** — try to query the Basic table the way an
   alert rule would:

   ```powershell
   az monitor log-analytics query --workspace $WS `
     --analytics-query "AZFWApplicationRule | join kind=inner (Heartbeat) on \$left.TimeGenerated == \$right.TimeGenerated | take 5" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** an error. Basic tables support simple filters and not
   much else. That restriction *is* the discount — you are paying less because
   you promised to ask less.

3. **The policy is reporting:**

   ```powershell
   az policy state summarize -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     --query "value[0].results" -o json
   ```

   **You should see:** a compliance summary within about 30 minutes — *if* the
   assignment was made. With the default `assignAuditPolicy = false` there is
   nothing to summarise, and the template's `policyAssignmentId` output says
   so rather than pretending.

4. **The budget exists and has three thresholds:**

   ```powershell
   az consumption budget list --query "[].{name:name, amount:amount, notifications:keys(notifications)}" -o json
   ```

   **You should see:** 50% actual, 90% actual, 100% forecast. The forecast one
   is the only one that gives you time to act — the other two tell you about
   money already spent.

5. **Come back tomorrow.** Re-run the Usage query from the top of this page.
   The firewall application-rule table should have moved from $2.76/GB to
   $0.50/GB without losing a single row.

## ➡️ What carries forward

Level 2 is complete: the estate is collected, visible, alerting and governed,
for about **$0.07/hr** on top of Level 1. Level 3 puts Microsoft Defender for
Cloud on top of this, sending its findings into **this** workspace, using
**these** table plans and **this** action group.
