# Curriculum Redesign — the Azure operational maturity path 🧭

**Status: merged to `main`.** All six levels have chapter structure, learning
objectives, dependencies, service inventory, cost — and code.

| Level | Outline | Code | Chapters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Level 1 · Deploy | ✅ | ✅ | the existing labs, unchanged |
| Level 2 · Monitor | ✅ | ✅ | L2.1 · L2.2 · L2.3 · L2.4 |
| Level 3 · Secure | ✅ | ✅ | L3.1 · L3.2 · L3.3 · L3.4 |
| Level 4 · Protect | ✅ | ✅ | L4.1 · L4.2 · L4.3 · L4.4 |
| Level 5 · Detect | ✅ | ✅ | L5.1 · L5.2 · L5.3 |
| Level 6 · Recover | ✅ | ✅ | L6.1 · L6.2 · L6.3 |

**18 chapters, 18 templates, 5 workflows, 18 walkthrough pages.** Every template
compiles clean under Bicep 0.46.1 with no linter warnings. Nothing has been
deployed against a live subscription.

Nothing here changes the four labs that exist today. The existing
[L1.1](Curriculum-L1-1-Core-Deployment.md)–[L1.4](Curriculum-L1-4-Production-Platform.md)
pages, their Bicep and their workflows are untouched and still deployable. The
redesign *re-frames* them as the first level of a longer path.

## The problem this fixes

Today's four labs are four ways to **deploy**. A learner finishes L1.4 knowing how
to stand infrastructure up, and nothing about what happens for the rest of that
infrastructure's life. Real Azure environments spend a few hours being deployed
and then years being watched, hardened, backed up, investigated and recovered.

The redesign keeps a single environment alive across the whole curriculum and
walks it through the operational lifecycle:

**Deploy → Monitor → Secure → Protect → Detect → Recover**

Every level operates on the *same* resources the previous levels created. No
level deploys a parallel environment to demonstrate a feature in isolation.

## The six levels

| Level | Theme | Chapters | Builds on | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1** | Azure Foundation & Deployment | L1.1 – L1.4 | — | [Level 1 · Deploy](Curriculum-Level-1-Deploy.md) |
| **Level 2** | Operations, Monitoring & Observability | L2.1 – L2.4 | Level 1 | [Level 2 · Monitor](Curriculum-Level-2-Monitor.md) |
| **Level 3** | Security & Microsoft Defender for Cloud | L3.1 – L3.4 | Levels 1–2 | [Level 3 · Secure](Curriculum-Level-3-Secure.md) |
| **Level 4** | Backup, Protection & Recovery Readiness | L4.1 – L4.4 | Levels 1–3 | [Level 4 · Protect](Curriculum-Level-4-Protect.md) |
| **Level 5** | Microsoft Sentinel | L5.1 – L5.3 | Levels 1–4 | [Level 5 · Detect](Curriculum-Level-5-Detect.md) |
| **Level 6** | Disaster Recovery & Redundancy | L6.1 – L6.3 | Levels 1–4 | [Level 6 · Recover](Curriculum-Level-6-Recover.md) |

Levels 5 and 6 are **parallel tracks**. Both assume Levels 1–4 are complete, and
neither depends on the other, so a class can run either one, both, or neither.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

Six level groups stacked top to bottom, each containing its chapters in order.

**Level 1** is the only level with internal branching, and it is inherited from
the labs as they exist today: L1.1 is a prerequisite for everything, L1.2 and
L1.3 both hang off L1.1 as siblings, and L1.4 extends L1.3. L1.3 does **not**
require L1.2, which is what lets a cost-constrained class tear the Azure
Firewall down and keep going.

Levels 2, 3 and 4 are strictly linear inside themselves, and each depends on the
level above it: Level 2 instruments the resources Level 1 created, Level 3
consumes Level 2's Log Analytics workspace to hold its security data, and Level 4
protects the resources while reporting through Level 2's alerting and Level 3's
governance.

Levels 5 and 6 both branch off Level 4 and are independent of each other. Level 5
(Microsoft Sentinel) needs the workspace and the connected data sources that
Levels 2 and 3 produced. Level 6 (disaster recovery) needs an environment worth
recovering and a definition of what "healthy" means, which is Level 2's work.

The arrow labels name what actually carries forward, not just an ordering:
resources, then a workspace and telemetry, then posture and alerts, then a
complete governed estate.

## What every chapter page contains

The six level pages follow one shape, so a chapter can be lifted straight into
lab authoring later:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | One sentence: what the learner can do afterwards |
| **Learning objectives** | 4–6 verifiable outcomes, written as capabilities |
| **Builds on** | The exact chapters and resources this chapter consumes |
| **Azure services** | Service inventory — what is new, what is reused |
| **Estimated cost** | Incremental $/hr, running total, and the dominant meter |
| **Cost optimization** | The specific lever available in *this* chapter |

## Cost is a first-class topic, not an appendix

Every chapter states its own cost. Every level ends with a cost summary. The
whole model — unit rates, assumptions, the categories tracked across the
curriculum, and the optimization levers — lives on
**[Curriculum Cost Model](Curriculum-Cost-Model.md)**.

Two facts shape the entire design:

- **Azure Firewall Standard ($1.25/hr) is still the single largest line item**,
  bigger than every monitoring, security, backup and DR component combined.
- **After Level 1, almost every new cost is usage-based, not resource-based.**
  Levels 2–5 bill mostly on log ingestion (GB/day), which means the learner
  controls the bill by choosing what to collect. That is itself a teachable
  skill, and it is the reason cost belongs in every chapter rather than in a
  footnote.

> retail pay-as-you-go rates, verified against the Azure Retail Prices API on
> **8 August 2026**. Usage-based lines depend on assumptions that are stated
> where they are used. Confirm against Azure Cost Management before committing a
> budget.

## Permissions escalate as the levels do

Every chapter page carries an **Azure Up to date** box stating the minimum RBAC
and Microsoft Entra ID roles that chapter needs, and why. The pattern across the
curriculum is worth seeing in one place, because it is not flat — the deeper the
level, the further the required rights move away from the person doing the lab.

| Level | Azure RBAC | Microsoft Entra ID | Who holds it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 · Deploy** | Contributor on one resource group | — | The participant |
| **2 · Monitor** | Contributor (Monitoring Contributor is enough) | — | The participant |
| | *Policy assignment* → Resource Policy Contributor | — | Instructor |
| **3 · Secure** | Contributor for per-resource settings | — | The participant |
| | Security Reader (subscription) to see the whole score | — | Instructor grants |
| | *Defender plans* → Security Admin or Owner | — | Instructor |
| | *Attaching WAF* → CDN Profile Contributor | — | The participant |
| **4 · Protect** | Contributor; Backup Contributor for vault work | — | The participant |
| | *Multi-user authorization* → Owner on the Resource Guard | — | Instructor |
| **5 · Detect** | **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** on the workspace | **Global Administrator** or **Security Administrator** to connect Microsoft Entra ID logs | Instructor + a directory admin |
| **6 · Recover** | Contributor; Site Recovery Contributor for replication | — | The participant |

Two things follow from that table, and both belong in the lab design rather than
in a troubleshooting page:

- **Level 5 is the first level that needs a role outside Azure.** The Microsoft
  Entra ID data connector is granted in the directory, not the subscription, and
  in most organisations that is a different person on a different team. A class
  that reaches L5.1 without arranging it in advance stops there.
- **`Setup-Oidc.ps1` grants Contributor on one resource group, deliberately.**
  Anything above that line is an instructor action with its own script, so the
  lab identity never quietly accumulates rights it does not need. Where a
  chapter needs more, its template defaults to off and says so.

## Recommendations for balancing scope, cost and learning

1. **Never re-deploy to demonstrate.** If a chapter needs a resource, it either
   exists from an earlier level or the chapter explains why a new one is
   justified. This is the rule that separates the redesign from what exists now.
2. **Make Level 1 tear-down-able, and say so in Level 1.** L1.2's firewall is
   the only optional-but-expensive component; the curriculum should keep the
   existing escape hatch (L1.3 needs only L1.1) rather than forcing a chain.
3. **Teach the free tier before the paid plan.** Defender's foundational CSPM,
   Azure Activity logs, Sentinel's free data sources and Azure Policy are all
   free. A chapter should reach its learning objective on free capability first,
   then enable one paid plan deliberately, with the meter on screen.
4. **Run Level 5 inside Microsoft Sentinel's 31-day free trial.** The first
   10 GB/day is waived for both ingestion and analysis, which turns the most
   expensive level in the curriculum into the cheapest — but only if the class
   schedule respects the window.
5. **Cap the estate at four VMs.** Per-node pricing (Defender for Servers, Azure
   Backup, Site Recovery) multiplies by node count. Four is enough to teach
   fleet behaviour and small enough to keep every per-node meter under $1/day.
6. **Prefer "design it, cost it, don't deploy it" for the premium tiers.**
   Azure Firewall Premium, Front Door Premium/WAF and zone-redundant SQL are
   architecturally important and disproportionately expensive. Model them,
   price them, and deploy them only in an instructor-led window.
7. **Put a cost checkpoint at the end of each level, not only at the end.** The
   existing teardown guidance is good; the redesign should add a "what is
   running right now, and what does it cost" review at four more places.
8. **Reuse the existing artifacts.** Level 1 is the existing Bicep unchanged.
   The cost model extends `unit cost/Build-CostDocs.ps1`'s rate table rather
   than starting a second source of truth.
