# L1.4 — Production-Ready Platform Deployment 🔴

**📍 [Level 1 · Deploy](Curriculum-Level-1-Deploy.md)** · Chapter 4 of 4 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [L1.3 — Multi-Service Application](Curriculum-L1-3-Multi-Service-Application.md) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [🗺️ Curriculum Map](Curriculum-Map.md)

---

**Goal:** the production upgrade of L1.3 — survive a regional outage. A second-region app stack in `westus2`, an **Azure SQL failover group**, and **Azure Front Door** as the single global entry point with health-probed failover. Then grade the result against the Well-Architected Framework, the way a real design review would.

| Who this is for | Time | You need first | Cost while it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab 4 of 4 · everyone | ~15 min, plus ~10 for Front Door to propagate | L1.3 deployed | 🔴 ~$1.84/hr running total |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **L1.3 must already be deployed.** L1.4 joins L1.3's SQL server to a failover group and creates a second SQL server with the same admin login (`sqladminuser`). Its password comes from the `SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` secret: set it before L1.3 and keep it, and both servers share one password, as a real failover pair should. Without the secret, each run generates its own one-time password, so the two servers' passwords differ.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

Front Door is the single global entry point. It health-probes both regions with
`GET /` every 30 seconds and sends traffic to the **priority 1** origin — the
L1.3 app in `eastus2` — falling back to the **priority 2** secondary in
`westus2` only when the primary stops answering.

The two SQL servers are joined by a **failover group**. Its listener hostname
is the one endpoint that survives a failover: point an application at
`fog-...database.windows.net` and it follows whichever server is currently
primary, without a connection-string change.

The dashed red line is deliberate and worth studying. The secondary region is
**slim**: no VNet integration, no Key Vault, no Application Insights. And
`sql-iacdemo-xxxxxx-dr` has public access disabled with **no private endpoint**
— so after a failover, nothing can actually reach the promoted database. The
ARM operation succeeds and the data path does not exist.

That is a Well-Architected gap you can close yourself, and the Copilot prompt
further down this page does exactly that.

> [!NOTE]
> **The secondary region is deliberately slim.** It has no VNet integration, no Key Vault and no Application Insights, and the DR database has no private endpoint. That is a teaching choice, not an oversight — it keeps the lab affordable and gives you something concrete to fix. The [Well-Architected scorecard](#-what-the-well-architected-framework-would-say) at the end of this page is where that bill comes due.

## 🚀 Deploy it — pick any one of three ways

All three deploy the **same** template and give the **same** result.

> [!NOTE]
> **🏫 Classroom: use Option 2 (GitHub Actions).** Your Azure account holds Reader, so the local `az deployment` commands in Options 1 and 3 will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the shared workshop identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## <img src="bicep.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 1 · Bicep from the terminal

**Best if you like the command line** (self-hosted only). Your values are already loaded from `lab-settings.csv` (set up in L1.1) — nothing to re-type.

```powershell
az deployment group what-if --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L1.4-production-platform/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create  --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L1.4-production-platform/main.bicepparam
```

**You should see:** a `frontDoorEndpoint` output — a full URL including `https://`. The deployment finishes before Front Door is actually serving; allow about ten more minutes for the edge to propagate before test 1 succeeds.

<br>

---

## <img src="gh-actions.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 2 · GitHub Actions (push-button)

**Best if you'd rather click a button.** Classroom forks are pre-wired — nothing to set up; self-hosted needs the one-time `Setup-Oidc.ps1` ([Deployment Guide](Deployment-Guide.md)).

On GitHub: **Actions → "Curriculum L1.4 - Production-Ready Platform" → Run workflow** (or `gh workflow run curriculum-l1-4-production-platform.yml`).

**You should see:** **Lint → What-if → Deploy**, then a final step printing the Front Door endpoint.

<br>

---

## <img src="gh-copilot.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 3 · GitHub Copilot (plain English)

**Best if you'd rather describe the change** and have AI edit and deploy it. The deploy step is self-hosted only (classroom accounts hold Reader).

Copilot runs the deploy **locally**, so (self-hosted) load your values once first (same file as Option 1): `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`.

Open **Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L1.4-production-platform/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Want to change the routing first?** Ask:

> Switch the Front Door origin group in `curriculum/L1.4-production-platform/main.bicep` to weighted round-robin between both regions instead of priority failover, run `az bicep build`, then deploy.

**Or close the Well-Architected gap** — the flagship exercise for this lab:

> In `curriculum/L1.4-production-platform/main.bicep`, the DR server `sql-<prefix>-<suffix>-dr` sets `publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'` but has no private endpoint, so nothing can reach it after a failover. Add a secondary VNet in `westus2` with a private-endpoint subnet, a private DNS zone linked to it, and a private endpoint on the DR server. Run `az bicep build`, then `what-if`.

Copilot edits, verifies, and deploys — and fixes any error you paste back.

<br>

---

## ✅ Verify it

Fetch the Front Door hostname rather than typing it — the endpoint name has a generated hash you can't guess:

```powershell
$FDE = az afd endpoint list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
  --profile-name (az afd profile list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --query "[0].name" -o tsv) `
  --query "[0].hostName" -o tsv
"https://$FDE/"
```

**You should see:** a hostname like `fde-yourprefix-a1b2c3.z01.azurefd.net`, with **no** scheme. The deployment output includes `https://` already, so pasting that into `$FDE` instead would give you `https://https://…`.

1. **Traffic reaches the primary through Front Door**

   ```powershell
   curl.exe -sI "https://$FDE/"
   ```

   **You should see:** `HTTP/2 200`. If you get a 4xx or a connection error, Front Door is still propagating — wait a few minutes and retry.

2. **Failing the primary moves traffic to the secondary** — deactivate the *active* revision, not just the first one listed:

   ```powershell
   $APP = "ca-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-web"
   $REVISION = az containerapp revision list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $APP `
     --query "[?properties.active].name | [0]" -o tsv
   az containerapp revision deactivate -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $APP --revision $REVISION
   curl.exe -s "https://$FDE/"
   ```

   **You should see:** the endpoint keep responding after 30–90 seconds, once the health probes mark the primary down. Front Door has switched to the `westus2` origin. The page looks identical because both regions run the same image.

   **Then put it back:**

   ```powershell
   az containerapp revision activate -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $APP --revision $REVISION
   ```

3. **The database has a listener that survives failover** — this, not the server names, is what an application should connect to:

   ```powershell
   $PRIMARY_SQL = az sql server list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     --query "[?starts_with(name, 'sql-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-') && !ends_with(name, '-dr')].name | [0]" -o tsv
   $FOG = az sql failover-group list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --server $PRIMARY_SQL --query "[0].name" -o tsv
   az sql failover-group show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --server $PRIMARY_SQL --name $FOG `
     --query "{listener:name, role:replicationRole, partners:partnerServers[].id}" -o yaml
   ```

   **You should see:** the group's `replicationRole` as `Primary`. Its listener is `<group-name>.database.windows.net` — point a connection string at that and it follows whichever server is currently primary, with no change on failover.

4. **Fail the database over, and back**

   ```powershell
   $DR_SQL = az sql server list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     --query "[?starts_with(name, 'sql-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-') && ends_with(name, '-dr')].name | [0]" -o tsv
   az sql failover-group set-primary -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --server $DR_SQL --name $FOG
   ```

   **You should see:** the command succeed, and re-running test 3 report `Secondary` for the original server. Fail back by running `set-primary` against `$PRIMARY_SQL`.

   > [!WARNING]
   > This one succeeds while leaving you worse off, and that is the point. The DR server has public access disabled and **no private endpoint**, so nothing can actually reach the database you just promoted. The scorecard below explains why, and the Copilot prompt above fixes it.

## 📋 What the Well-Architected Framework would say

L1.4 is the production upgrade of L1.3, and grading it against WAF is the point of
the lab — a real design review does exactly this.

| Pillar | How L1.4 scores |
|---|---|
| **Reliability** | ✅ Two regions, health-probed automatic failover, geo-replicated data, and a failover-group listener that survives promotion without a connection-string change. |
| **Operational Excellence** | ✅ The whole topology is one template. Front Door, the second region and the failover group deploy together or not at all. |
| **Performance Efficiency** | ✅ Front Door terminates at the edge and routes to the healthy origin. |
| **Cost Optimization** | ⚠️ The secondary runs warm at all times. Real DR balances that against your recovery-time objective. |
| **Security** | ❌ **The DR region has no private data path.** `sql-<prefix>-<suffix>-dr` disables public access but has no private endpoint, and the secondary app has no VNet integration. Test 4 above reports success while leaving the database unreachable. |

That last row is the lesson. Under WAF, a DR region you cannot reach privately
is not a DR region — and a failover that "succeeds" into an unreachable database
is worse than no failover at all, because every dashboard says you are fine.

**Close it yourself:** the second Copilot prompt in Option 3 adds the secondary
VNet, private DNS zone and private endpoint. That is the difference between a
lab that demonstrates multi-region and a design that would pass review.

> **You just used it:** every deployment this repo creates is named with the run that produced it — `l1-4-deploy-42` comes from GitHub Actions run number 42. Azure's deployment history and your CI history share a key.
> **Find it:** `az deployment group list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --query "[].name" -o tsv`, then open that run number in the **Actions** tab to see exactly what was deployed, by whom, from which commit.
> **Beyond the lab:** during an incident, "which change did this?" becomes one lookup instead of an archaeology session. It costs one line of YAML: `--name l1-4-deploy-${{ github.run_number }}`.

## ➡️ What carries forward

You have built the whole stack. Two things are worth doing next.

**Close the WAF gap.** The Copilot prompt in Option 3 gives the DR region a real
data path. It is the most realistic exercise in the workshop, because you are
fixing a design rather than following instructions.

**Then tear it down.** Front Door, Firewall, Bastion and SQL all bill while
idle — about **$1.84/hr** with everything running.

**Classroom:** run the **"Teardown labs"** workflow on your fork — **Actions → Teardown labs → Run workflow**. Self-hosted, the script does the same thing, with a preview:

```powershell
./scripts/Cleanup-Labs.ps1 -ResourceGroup $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -WhatIf   # self-hosted
./scripts/Cleanup-Labs.ps1 -ResourceGroup $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP          # self-hosted
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Both paths delete every resource in the group (the script prompts for confirmation first). They leave the resource group itself in place, which is what you want in a classroom — you can't recreate it with Reader.
