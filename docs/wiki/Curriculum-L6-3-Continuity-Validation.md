# L6.3 — Business Continuity & Validation 🔴

**📍 [Level 6 · Recover](Curriculum-Level-6-Recover.md)** · Chapter 3 of 3 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [L6.2 — Disaster Recovery Implementation](Curriculum-L6-2-Disaster-Recovery.md) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [Cleanup & Reset](Cleanup-and-Reset.md)

**Goal:** prove the recovery capability instead of asserting it. An
availability SLO alert, plus a drill workbook that turns each exercise into
evidence with numbers in it.

**The IaC lesson:** evidence as code — the SLO target, the drill record and
every continuity query live in the repository, so "we meet 99%" has a
definition, a measurement and a commit history instead of being a claim in a
slide deck.

<br>

| Who this is for | Time | You need first | Cost while it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chapter 3 of Level 6 · everyone | ~20 min | **L6.1** and **L6.2**; L2.2 and L4.3 for the data | 🟢 **$0.00/hr steady state** · $2–5 per drill |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every query on this chapter's workbook reads data an earlier level already
> collects** — availability from L2.2, backup and restore history from L4.3,
> replication health from L6.2. Nothing new is instrumented.

<br>

## What you're building

Two small deployments, both made entirely of data the estate already collects.
An SLO alert watches the L2.2 availability test over a 24-hour window and
fires when the promise slips below target, and a continuity workbook puts
measured availability, backup history and a fill-in-during-the-exercise drill
record on one page. That a well-instrumented estate can already answer
continuity questions without a special project is the finding.

Two things deploy, and both are made entirely of data that already exists.

The **SLO alert** measures availability over 24 hours from the L2.2 web test and
fires when it falls below the target. It is not an outage alert — L2.3 already
answers "is it up right now". This one answers "did we keep the promise", which
can fire on a morning when nothing is currently broken. That difference is the
whole of service-level thinking.

The **continuity workbook** puts measured availability, backup and restore
durations, and a blank drill record on one page. The drill table is meant to be
filled in *during* the exercise, not afterwards from memory, and the column that
matters is the gap between the target and the measured number.

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — why an untested DR posture is a false saving</b></summary>

<br>

The cheapest possible DR posture is an untested one. That is exactly why it is
a false saving. A drill costs $2–5 in temporary resources and an hour of
someone's time; discovering the plan does not work during a real outage costs
considerably more. Schedule the drill, keep the receipts, and delete the
temporary resources the same day.

> [!NOTE]
> **🏫 Classroom: use the GitHub Actions option.** Your Azure account holds Reader, so local `az deployment` commands will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the workshop deploy identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## 🚀 Deploy it — pick any one of three ways

## <img src="bicep.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 1 · Bicep from the terminal

```powershell
az deployment group what-if --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L6.3-continuity-validation/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create  --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L6.3-continuity-validation/main.bicepparam
```

**You should see:** `availabilityTarget` stating the promise,
`everyQueryIsInherited` listing which level each number comes from, and
`theClosingArgument` — the sentence the whole curriculum has been building to.

**Actions → "Curriculum L6 - Disaster Recovery & Redundancy" → Run workflow →
L6.3 - Business Continuity & Validation**.

Safe to run. The SLO alert may fire on its first evaluation if the availability test has had a bad day, which is a useful first incident.

<br>

## <img src="gh-copilot.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 3 · GitHub Copilot (plain English)

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L6.3-continuity-validation/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Then have it write the runbook you will actually use:**

> Read `curriculum/L6.2-disaster-recovery/main.bicep` and `curriculum/L1.4-production-platform/main.bicep`, then write a regional failover runbook for this environment in the correct order — data, then app, then traffic — with the exact az commands and a rollback step for each.

Then have somebody who did not write it execute it. Every ambiguity they hit at
their desk is one they would have hit at 03:00 with an incident bridge
listening. A runbook only its author can follow is not a runbook.

<br>

---

## ✅ Verify it

1. **The SLO alert exists and knows its target:**

   ```powershell
   az monitor scheduled-query show -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n "alert-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-availability-slo" `
     --query "{enabled:enabled, window:windowSize, frequency:evaluationFrequency}" -o table
   ```

2. **Run a test failover that touches nothing real:**

   ```powershell
   az site-recovery protected-item failover test --help
   ```

   **You should see:** a VM come up in the recovery region, isolated from
   production. Time it. Compare it to the RTO you wrote down before starting —
   the gap is the finding, and the finding is the deliverable.

   **Clean up the test failover afterwards.** It bills while it exists.

3. **Fail the database over deliberately** — the L1.4 failover group, used in
   anger for the first time:

   ```powershell
   $FOG = az sql failover-group list -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -s $SQL --query "[0].name" -o tsv
   az sql failover-group set-primary -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -s "$SQL-dr" -n $FOG
   ```

   The name carries a `uniqueString` suffix, so it is looked up rather than
   typed — the same reason L1.3's Key Vault and SQL server names are never
   hardcoded anywhere in this curriculum.

   **You should see:** the listener endpoint follow the new primary, and the app
   keep working without a connection-string change — which is the entire point
   of a failover group, and only obvious once you have watched it.
   Fail it back afterwards.

4. **Check the monitoring noticed.** During the drill, did anything from Level 2
   or Level 3 fire? If a regional failover produced no alerts at all, the
   monitoring has a gap — and finding that in a drill rather than an incident is
   the best possible outcome.

5. **Write the one-page continuity standard.** RTO and RPO per tier, the measured
   numbers next to them, the drill date, and the cost. That document is the
   output of Level 6 — and of the curriculum. The numbers in it are defensible
   because you measured them rather than quoting an SLA.

## ➡️ What carries forward

**The curriculum is complete.** Deploy → Monitor → Secure → Protect → Detect →
Recover, on one environment, for about $2.55/hr — of which the Azure Firewall
from L1.2 alone is $1.25/hr. Tear down in reverse order, and check the three
things that outlive a resource group cleanup: Site Recovery replication,
Recovery Services vault contents, and retained Log Analytics data.
