# Curriculum Cost Model 💰

Every figure on the six level pages of the
**[Curriculum Redesign](Curriculum-Redesign.md)**
is derived here. This page holds the unit rates, the assumptions behind the
usage-based lines, the cost categories tracked across the whole curriculum, and
the optimization levers available at each stage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Planning estimates, not a quote.** East US 2 (West US 2 for the secondary
> region), US retail pay-as-you-go rates. Rates marked *Verified 2026-08-08* came
> back from the Azure Retail Prices API on that date; rates marked
> *Repo 2026-08-04* are the existing lab rates in `unit cost/Build-CostDocs.ps1`.
> Your invoice will differ under an EA, CSP or MCA agreement.

## The ten cost categories

These are the categories the curriculum should track and label at every chapter.
Each behaves differently, and confusing them is the most common budgeting
mistake in Azure.

| # | Category | Billing shape | Introduced at | Controlled by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Always-on infrastructure** | Per hour, while deployed | L1.1 | Deleting it. Nothing else. |
| 2 | **Network & data processing** | Per GB moved or inspected | L1.2 | Traffic volume, egress zone |
| 3 | **Standby & redundancy premium** | Per hour, delivers nothing on a normal day | L1.4 | Architecture choice |
| 4 | **Telemetry ingestion** | Per GB ingested | L2.1 | What you collect, and into which table plan |
| 5 | **Telemetry retention & archive** | Per GB-month | L2.4 | Retention period, tier |
| 6 | **Alerting & automation** | Per rule-month, per action | L2.3 | Rule count and evaluation frequency |
| 7 | **Per-node protection plans** | Per node/instance-month | L3.2 | Node count, plan tier, enablement scope |
| 8 | **Backup & recovery storage** | Per GB-month × redundancy | L4.1 | Retention × redundancy × instances |
| 9 | **Security analytics** | Per GB analysed | L5.1 | Connector selection, table plan |
| 10 | **Event & drill costs** | Per event, transient | L4.3, L6.3 | Frequency, and cleaning up afterwards |

Three properties are worth teaching explicitly:

- **Categories 1 and 3 bill while idle.** They are the only ones a teardown
  fully removes, and the only ones that cost money overnight for nothing.
- **Categories 4, 5, 8 and 9 accumulate.** They grow with time even when the
  architecture is frozen, which is why they are the most commonly
  under-forecast lines in a real bill.
- **Category 8 survives teardown.** Deleting a VM does not delete its recovery
  points.

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Containers protects AKS, Arc-enabled Kubernetes and registry
> images. It does **not** provide runtime protection for Azure Container Apps,
> so the L1.3 workload is covered by CSPM posture rather than by a workload
> plan. The rate is listed for completeness and for the architecture discussion
> in L3.2, not because the curriculum enables it.

## Usage assumptions

Every usage-based figure on the level pages comes from one of these. They are
deliberately conservative for a small teaching estate.

| Assumption | Value | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Estate size | 4 × B2s VMs, 1 firewall, 1 load balancer, 2 container replicas, 2 SQL databases, 1 Key Vault, 1 Front Door | All levels |
| Baseline platform + VM insights ingestion | 0.5 GB/day | L2.1 |
| Application Insights telemetry | 0.15 GB/day | L2.2 |
| Availability test cadence | 2 locations every 15 min = 8 executions/hr | L2.2 |
| Alert rule set | 10 metric + 4 log rules at 5-minute evaluation | L2.3 |
| Security export and security events | 0.25 GB/day | L3.3 |
| Backup data stored | ~40 GB (4 VMs, compressed OS disks) | L4.1, L4.4 |
| Backup job telemetry | 0.05 GB/day | L4.3 |
| Sentinel paid connector volume | 1.0 GB/day | L5.1 |
| UEBA behaviour analytics | 0.1 GB/day | L5.2 |
| Logic Apps playbook actions | a few thousand per month | L3.3, L5.3 |
| VMs run continuously; nothing is deallocated | — | All levels |

## Full cost progression

Running totals assume everything from earlier chapters is still deployed.

| Chapter | Adds | Running total |
|---|---|---|
| L1.1 Core Deployment | +$0.24/hr | **$0.24/hr** |
| L1.2 Architecture Expansion | +$1.41/hr | **$1.65/hr** |
| L1.3 Multi-Service Application | +$0.08/hr | **$1.73/hr** |
| L1.4 Production-Ready Platform | +$0.11/hr | **$1.84/hr** |
| L2.1 Monitoring Fundamentals | +$0.06/hr | **$1.90/hr** |
| L2.2 Operational Visibility | +$0.02/hr | **$1.92/hr** |
| L2.3 Proactive Operations | +$0.01/hr | **$1.93/hr** |
| L2.4 Enterprise Monitoring Strategy | −$0.02/hr net | **$1.91/hr** |
| L3.1 Security Foundation | +$0.00/hr | **$1.91/hr** |
| L3.2 Workload Protection | +$0.07/hr | **$1.98/hr** |
| L3.3 Security Operations | +$0.03/hr | **$2.01/hr** |
| L3.4 Enterprise Security Architecture | +$0.00/hr as designed | **$2.01/hr** |
| L4.1 Backup Fundamentals | +$0.06/hr | **$2.07/hr** |
| L4.2 PaaS Protection | +$0.01/hr | **$2.08/hr** |
| L4.3 Operational Backup Management | +$0.01/hr | **$2.09/hr** |
| L4.4 Enterprise Data Protection | +$0.01/hr | **$2.10/hr** |
| L5.1 Sentinel Foundation | +$0.31/hr *(free in trial)* | **$2.41/hr** |
| L5.2 Detection & Investigation | +$0.03/hr *(free in trial)* | **$2.44/hr** |
| L5.3 SOC Operations & Automation | +$0.01/hr | **$2.45/hr** |
| L6.1 High Availability & Redundancy | +$0.06/hr | **$2.16/hr** † |
| L6.2 Disaster Recovery Implementation | +$0.04/hr | **$2.20/hr** † |
| L6.3 Business Continuity & Validation | +$0.00/hr steady state | **$2.20/hr** † |

† Levels 5 and 6 are parallel tracks that both start from Level 4's $2.10/hr.
Level 6's running totals exclude Level 5. A class that runs **both**, with
Sentinel outside its free trial, reaches about **$2.55/hr**.

### Where the money actually goes

| Phase | Adds | Share of the $2.55/hr full stack |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 · Deploy | $1.84/hr | **72%** |
| Level 2 · Monitor | $0.07/hr | 3% |
| Level 3 · Secure | $0.10/hr | 4% |
| Level 4 · Protect | $0.09/hr | 4% |
| Level 5 · Detect | $0.35/hr | 14% |
| Level 6 · Recover | $0.10/hr | 4% |

**Azure Firewall Standard alone is $1.25/hr — 49% of the full stack, and more
than Levels 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 combined.** The five operational levels together
add $0.71/hr, which is less than the firewall. That single comparison is the
most useful cost slide in the curriculum, and it should appear in Level 1 rather
than at the end.

## Optimization levers, by size of effect

| Lever | Saving | Where it is taught |
|---|---|---|
| Tear down L1.2's firewall and web tier before Level 2 | −$1.41/hr | L1.2 |
| Azure Firewall Basic instead of Standard | −$0.855/hr | L1.2 |
| Run Level 5 inside the Sentinel free trial | −$0.34/hr for 31 days | L5.1 |
| Do not deploy Front Door Premium for WAF | avoids +$0.40/hr | L3.4 |
| Do not upgrade to Azure Firewall Premium | avoids +$0.50/hr | L3.4 |
| Keep SQL on Basic rather than a zone-redundant tier | avoids +$0.25/hr | L6.1 |
| Route verbose logs to Basic or Auxiliary tiers | −$0.03/hr at lab volume | L2.4 |
| Defender for Servers Plan 1 instead of Plan 2 | −$0.053/hr on 4 VMs | L3.2 |
| Protect one VM with Site Recovery, not four | −$0.10/hr | L6.2 |
| Scale the container app to zero minimum replicas | −$0.054/hr per region | L1.3 |
| LRS instead of GRS backup storage | −50% of backup storage | L4.1 |
| Enable Defender plans at resource scope, not subscription | avoids charging unrelated resources | L3.2 |
| Deallocate VMs overnight | −$0.0416/hr per VM (disks still bill) | L1.1 |
| 15-minute instead of 1-minute log alert evaluation | −$2.50/rule/month | L2.3 |
| Archive old recovery points instead of shortening retention | −90%+ of that storage | L4.4 |

## Keeping this page honest

The existing handouts in `unit cost/` are generated from a single rate table in
`Build-CostDocs.ps1`, so a price correction is a one-line change that
regenerates both documents. The lab-authoring phase should extend that same
table with the meters above rather than starting a second source of truth — the
script already computes incremental and cumulative totals from quantities, which
is exactly the shape this curriculum needs.

The four existing per-lab figures appear in both `README.md` and this site's
home page, and nothing cross-checks them any more (the wiki checker was retired
with the wiki). When these chapters become labs, update both places together.
