**Goal:** grade the architecture Level 1 built, honestly, against availability
zones and component redundancy — before spending anything on fixing it. This
chapter deploys a report, not redundancy.

**The IaC lesson:** an audit only turns into improvement when each finding
names the template that owns the fix — L6.1 measures, and every fix arrives as
a reviewed pull request against the Level 1 file that owns the resource.

<br>

| Who this is for | Time | You need first | Cost while it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chapter 1 of Level 6 · everyone | ~20 min | **Nothing** — the audit grades whatever the group contains; L2.2 enriches the measured half | 🟢 **$0.00/hr** — this chapter deploys a report, not redundancy |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This chapter changes nothing, deliberately.** Every redundancy upgrade
> belongs to the template that owns the resource, so L6.1 **measures** — and
> each fix arrives as a reviewed pull request against the right file.

## What you're building

One workbook, and no new redundancy. Azure Resource Graph — which is free —
reads the zone posture of everything in the resource group, and the workbook
grades it and names the four single points of failure L1.4 left behind. Each
finding points at the Level 1 template that owns the fix, with a price
attached.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

One workbook, fed by Azure Resource Graph, grading every resource in the group
by zone posture — zone-redundant, zonal, or neither — and then naming the four
single points of failure L1.4 left behind.

Three of the four are cheap to fix. Zone-redundant firewall and load balancer
cost **nothing extra** on the same SKU; a second container replica is $0.054/hr.
The fourth is not: the Basic-tier SQL database **cannot** be made zone-redundant
at any price, and leaving Basic costs about +$0.25/hr.

The dotted lines all point away from this chapter, at the Level 1 chapter templates. That is the
point. A redundancy grade produced by the monitoring team and a redundancy fix
made by the team that owns the workload are different activities, and conflating
them is how templates end up fighting each other.

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — the ownership rule, in full</b></summary>

<br>

Every redundancy upgrade in this estate belongs to the template that owns the
resource — the container app replica count is in
`curriculum/L1.3-multi-service-application`, the load balancer zones in
`curriculum/L1.2-architecture-expansion`. Fixing them from here would break the
ownership rule the whole curriculum runs on. So L6.1 **measures**, and each fix
arrives as a reviewed pull request against the right file.

</details>

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — an SLA is not an SLO is not a measurement</b></summary>

<br>

Azure publishes an SLA for each service; you choose an SLO; L2.2's availability
test tells you what actually happened. Put all three side by side for this
environment and the gaps are instructive — a 99.99% SLA on a component sitting
behind a single Basic Bastion does not make the *system* 99.99%.

> [!NOTE]
> **🏫 Classroom: use the GitHub Actions option.** Your Azure account holds Reader, so local `az deployment` commands will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the workshop deploy identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## 🚀 Deploy it — pick any one of three ways

<td align="center" width="240"><img src="bicep.png" width="70"><br><br><b>1 · Bicep CLI</b><br><sub>Copy-paste in the terminal</sub></td>

## <img src="bicep.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 1 · Bicep from the terminal

```powershell
az deployment group what-if --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L6.1-high-availability/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create  --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L6.1-high-availability/main.bicepparam
```

**You should see:** `freeFixes` and `paidFixes` split out, and `ownershipRule`
stating why this template changes nothing.

<br>

---

## <img src="gh-actions.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 2 · GitHub Actions (push-button)

**Actions → "Curriculum L6 - Disaster Recovery & Redundancy" → Run workflow →
L6.1 - High Availability & Redundancy**.

Nothing is deployed beyond a workbook, so this is safe to run at any point.

<br>

---

## <img src="gh-copilot.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 3 · GitHub Copilot (plain English)

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L6.1-high-availability/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Then ask it to break the rule and refuse:**

> Make the load balancer in this environment zone-redundant by editing `curriculum/L6.1-high-availability/main.bicep`.

There is no load balancer in this template to edit. The right change is in
`curriculum/L1.2-architecture-expansion/main.bicep`, which owns it — ask Copilot to make it there
instead, and notice that the fix is a one-line `zones` property and costs
nothing. The hard part was never the Bicep; it was knowing which file.

## ✅ Verify it

1. **Open the workbook** — **Azure Monitor → Workbooks →
   `L6.1 — <prefix> redundancy grade`**.

   **You should see:** most resources graded "Not zonal". That is the honest
   starting position for an environment built for teaching, and pretending
   otherwise would waste the chapter.

2. **Check the four known gaps:**

   ```powershell
   az graph query -q "resources | where resourceGroup =~ '$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP' | where type in~ ('microsoft.network/bastionhosts','microsoft.network/azurefirewalls','microsoft.sql/servers/databases','microsoft.app/containerapps') | project name, type, zones" -o table
   ```

3. **Compare the SLA, the SLO and the measurement.** Look up the published SLA
   for Azure Firewall, then run:

   ```powershell
   az monitor log-analytics query --workspace $WS `
     --analytics-query "AppAvailabilityResults | where TimeGenerated > ago(7d) | summarize Total=count(), Ok=countif(Success==true) | extend Measured = round(100.0*Ok/Total, 3)" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** a measured number that is not the SLA. Which is fine —
   the useful question is whether it clears the SLO *you* chose, and L6.3 turns
   that into an alert.

4. **Spend a fixed budget.** Give the class $0.10/hr and ask where it buys the
   most availability for this workload. The defensible answer is a second
   container replica plus the free zone settings — and *declining* the database
   upgrade with numbers is worth more than agreeing to it.

L6.2 builds the regional recovery capability for the tier that cannot simply be
redeployed — the stateful one.
