# L5.1 — Sentinel Foundation 🟠

**📍 [Level 5 · Detect](Curriculum-Level-5-Detect.md)** · Chapter 1 of 3 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [L4.1 — Backup Fundamentals](Curriculum-L4-1-Backup-Fundamentals.md) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [L5.2 — Detection & Investigation](Curriculum-L5-2-Detection-Investigation.md)

> Level 5 is an **extra-credit track**: the main path ends at L4.1, and this
> level starts here whenever you pick it up — before or after Level 6, or not
> at all. See the [Curriculum Map](Curriculum-Map.md).

**Goal:** enable Microsoft Sentinel on the workspace this curriculum has been
filling since L2.1, and connect only what is free before anything paid.
Nothing new gets built — the SIEM sits on top of data every previous level
already collected.

**The IaC lesson:** a template can declare its limits as well as its resources —
this one onboards Sentinel and its free connectors in a single deploy, and its
`paidAndBlocked` output names the one connector no template can enable.

<br>

| Who this is for | Time | You need first | Cost while it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chapter 1 of Level 5 · everyone | ~20 min | **L1.3's workspace** (filled since L2.1), and **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** granted to the shared deploy identity — ask the instructor | 🟠 **$0.00/hr in the trial** · +$0.31/hr after it |

> [!WARNING]
> **Sentinel bills analysis on everything in the workspace it is enabled on** —
> including the operations data Level 2 collected. The 31-day free trial waives
> the charges for the first 10 GB/day. **Run Level 5 inside the window.**

<br>

## What you're building

One template turns the existing workspace into a SIEM. Sentinel is enabled on
`log-iacdemo-l3` — the workspace every level has written into since L2.1 — and
only the free data sources are connected. One paid source stays deliberately
out of reach: Microsoft Entra ID sign-in and audit logs need a directory
admin, and no template — and no Azure role — can substitute for that.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

Sentinel is enabled **on the existing workspace** rather than a new one, which
is the decision the entire redesign has been building toward: every data source
Level 2 and Level 3 connected is already there, and nothing has to be
reconnected.

The green boxes are free. Azure Activity has been flowing since L2.1;
`SecurityAlert` and `SecurityIncident` arrive from the L3.3 export and carry no
Sentinel analysis charge at all. The template also demotes `AZFWNetworkRule` to
the **Basic** plan ($0.50/GB against Analytics' $2.76, and no Sentinel analysis
charge on Basic-tier data), because a table nothing detects on stops being
merely verbose once Sentinel is charging $4.76/GB analysis on top. Auxiliary is
cheaper still at $0.05/GB but is not offered for a standard Azure resource-log
table like this one.

The red boxes are the wall. Microsoft Entra ID sign-in and audit logs are paid
data **and** need a Global Administrator or Security Administrator to connect
them in the directory. No Azure permission substitutes for that — not your
Reader, and not the shared deploy identity's Contributor on the resource group.
Nobody in this lab can get there from here.

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — what switching Sentinel on does to the bill</b></summary>

<br>

The operations data Level 2 has been collecting is already in this workspace,
so switching Sentinel on applies a $4.76/GB analysis charge to it as well as
the $2.76/GB ingestion you were already paying — about $7.52/GB combined on
the Analytics plan. That is why L2.4's table-plan discipline mattered, and why
this template demotes the noisiest table on the way in.

The 31-day free trial waives both charges for the first 10 GB/day. This estate
fits inside it — which is what makes Level 5 nearly free inside the window and
the most expensive level in the curriculum outside it.

</details>

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — where Sentinel lives from here</b></summary>

<br>

The Azure portal experience retires after **31 March 2027**, and the Microsoft
Defender portal is the destination. The resources this template deploys are
unaffected — onboarding, connectors and rules are the same ARM resources
either way — but the screenshots in any course written today will age out
before the retirement does.

<sub>Why: onboarding Sentinel and creating data connectors are <code>Microsoft.SecurityInsights</code> operations that Contributor on a resource group does not cover. This is the first chapter where the deploy identity genuinely needs a role upgrade rather than a workaround — the instructor grants it before the class, because a failed onboarding at minute five stops the level.

> [!NOTE]
> **🏫 Classroom: use the GitHub Actions option.** Your Azure account holds Reader, so local `az deployment` commands will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the shared workshop identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## <img src="bicep.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 1 · Bicep from the terminal

```powershell
az deployment group what-if --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L5.1-sentinel-foundation/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create  --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --parameters curriculum/L5.1-sentinel-foundation/main.bicepparam
```

**You should see:** `freeDataSources` listing what arrives at no charge,
`paidAndBlocked` naming the connector you cannot deploy, and `whatToWatch`
telling you which query to re-run tomorrow.

**Keep the demotion off if you want to see the difference:**

```powershell
$env:CURRICULUM_DEMOTE_VERBOSE = "false"   # then compare tomorrow's Usage bill

## <img src="gh-actions.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 2 · GitHub Actions (push-button)

**Actions → "Curriculum L5 - Microsoft Sentinel" → Run workflow →
L5.1 - Sentinel Foundation**.

If onboarding fails with an authorisation error, the shared deploy identity still has its usual Contributor and not **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** — ask the instructor to grant it. That is the expected failure, not a broken template.

<br>

## <img src="gh-copilot.png" width="30" align="top">&nbsp; Option 3 · GitHub Copilot (plain English)

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L5.1-sentinel-foundation/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Then ask it for the thing that is not yours to give:**

> Add a Microsoft Entra ID data connector to `curriculum/L5.1-sentinel-foundation/main.bicep` so we get sign-in logs.

Copilot will write a plausible `dataConnectors` resource of kind
`AzureActiveDirectory`. It will fail, and the error will be about permissions
rather than syntax. The connector requires a directory role no Azure RBAC
assignment can grant — which is the single most important thing to understand
before planning a Sentinel deployment for a real organisation.

<br>

## ✅ Verify it

1. **Sentinel is on the workspace you expected:**

   ```powershell
   az sentinel onboarding-state show --workspace-name "log-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-l3" -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -o table
   ```

2. **The free connector is live:**

   ```powershell
   az sentinel data-connector list --workspace-name "log-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-l3" -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** the Defender for Cloud connector. Everything L3.3 exported
   is now Sentinel data at no additional analysis charge.

3. **Confirm the trial is running, and when it ends.** In the portal:
   **Microsoft Sentinel → News & guides → Free trial**. Write the end date in
   the class calendar. After it, this estate costs roughly $0.31/hr more.

4. **Do the arithmetic that decides the rest of the level:**

   ```powershell
   az monitor log-analytics query --workspace $WS `
     --analytics-query "Usage | where TimeGenerated > ago(24h) and IsBillable | summarize GB=sum(Quantity)/1000 by DataType | order by GB desc" -o table
   ```

   **You should see:** the same table you have been watching since L2.1 — but
   every row on the Analytics plan now costs about **$7.52/GB** rather than
   $2.76. Multiply it out. That number is the argument for every table-plan
   decision in the rest of Level 5.

## ➡️ What carries forward

L5.2 writes detections against exactly this data — and one of them joins
security data to operations data, which is only possible because every level
wrote into the same workspace.
