# L5.2 — Detection & Investigation 🟠

**📍 [Level 5 · Detect](Curriculum-Level-5-Detect.md)** · Chapter 2 of 3 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Previous: [L5.1 — Sentinel Foundation](Curriculum-L5-1-Sentinel-Foundation.md) &nbsp;·&nbsp; Next: [L5.3 — SOC Operations & Automation](Curriculum-L5-3-SOC-Operations.md)

**Goal:** write detections that fire on this environment’s real behaviour, then
investigate what they produce. Detection logic is free — you pay for the data,
not the queries.

**The IaC lesson:** a detection is a reviewable text artifact — each analytics
rule’s query, threshold, severity and entity mapping is Bicep a colleague can
argue with in a pull request before it ever pages anyone.

## What you're building

Three analytics rules, written as Bicep — two deploy, one is deliberately
withheld. Rule 1 joins Defender alerts to failed SQL logins; Rule 2 watches
the firewall's Basic-plan table for outbound destinations it has never seen;
Rule 3 needs sign-in logs nobody here has permission to connect. Both deployed
rules map entities, so their incidents can be investigated rather than just
counted.

<details><summary>Text description of this diagram</summary>

Three rules, two of which deploy.

**Rule 1** is the payoff for one workspace. It correlates repeated failed SQL
authentications — which exist because L3.2 turned on auditing — with Defender
for Cloud alerts on the same resource, which exist because L3.3 exported them.
Severity High, because the combination is far more specific than either half.

**Rule 2** queries `AZFWApplicationRule`, the table L5.1 moved to the Basic
plan, and looks for outbound destinations not seen in the previous seven days.
Severity Low on purpose: it is a hunting-grade signal promoted to a rule so the
class has something that actually fires to practise triage on.

**Rule 3** is deliberately **not deployed**. It needs `SigninLogs`, which needs
the directory connector nobody here can enable. A rule over an empty table never
fires and looks like coverage — worse than not existing.

Both deployed rules carry **entity mappings**. Without them an incident is a row
in a table; with them Sentinel can pivot to everything else that resource or
address touched.

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — the join that one workspace buys you</b></summary>

<br>

Rule 1 joins `SecurityAlert` to `SQLSecurityAuditEvents` — security data to
operations data. Neither table alone is an incident; the join is the
detection. That join exists because every level wrote into the *same*
workspace instead of standing up its own, which is the decision L2.1 made and
the entire redesign has been protecting since.

</details>

<details><summary><b>🔍 Going deeper — analytics rules over Basic tables</b></summary>

<br>

Rule 2 proves something about Basic tables. L2.4 taught that alert rules
cannot read them — that is true of Log Analytics *scheduled query* alerts.
Sentinel analytics rules over a Basic table work when the query is a simple
filter and aggregation, which this one is. The distinction is fiddly, real,
and exactly the kind of thing that gets a detection quietly disabled six
months later. Test the rule, do not assume the plan.

> **🏫 Classroom: use the GitHub Actions option.** Your Azure account holds Reader, so local `az deployment` commands will be refused — deploys go through your fork's workflow, which uses the shared workshop identity automatically. Compiling locally (`az bicep build`) works for everyone.

## 🚀 Deploy it — pick any one of three ways

Load your values first: `./scripts/Load-LabSettings.ps1`. Then in
**Copilot Chat → Agent mode**:

> Deploy `curriculum/L5.2-detection-investigation/main.bicep` to my lab resource group (`$env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`) with `az deployment group create`.

**Then make it write a detection for something you know happened:**

> In `curriculum/L5.2-detection-investigation/main.bicep`, add a scheduled analytics rule that fires when a backup job fails twice in 24 hours, using the AddonAzureBackupJobs table from L4.3. Map the resource as an entity. Run `az bicep build`, then show me a what-if.

Ask yourself whether that belongs in Sentinel at all. L4.3 already alerts on it
through Azure Monitor, for $0.50/month, without Sentinel analysis charges. Every
signal has a right home, and "we have a SIEM" is not a reason to route
everything through it.

<br>

## ✅ Verify it

1. **Both rules exist and are enabled:**

   ```powershell
   az sentinel alert-rule list --workspace-name "log-$env:AZURE_PREFIX-l3" -g $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP `
     --query "[].{name:displayName, severity:severity, enabled:enabled}" -o table
   ```

2. **Make Rule 1 fire** — repeat the failed-login test from L3.2 six or more
   times against the SQL server, then wait for the hourly evaluation:

   ```powershell
   1..8 | ForEach-Object { sqlcmd -S "$SQL.database.windows.net" -U notauser -P "wrong-$_" -Q "SELECT 1" }
   ```

   **You should see:** an incident within the hour, with the SQL server already
   attached as an entity. Open it and use the investigation graph — that pivot
   is what the entity mapping bought you.

3. **Check the MITRE coverage honestly:** in the portal, **Microsoft Sentinel →
   MITRE ATT&CK**.

   **You should see:** two techniques covered and a great many not. Say the
   number out loud. Two rules is not a detection strategy, and a coverage map
   that looks sparse is more useful than one that looks full because someone
   enabled every template rule without checking the data behind them.

4. **Hunt without an alert.** In **Hunting**, run:

   ```kql
   AzureActivity
   | where OperationNameValue has "delete" and ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
   | summarize Deletions = count() by Caller, ResourceGroup
   | order by Deletions desc
   ```

   **You should see:** your own teardown activity from earlier levels. Hunting
   starts from a hypothesis rather than a rule, and recognising your own
   footprints is the first step to recognising someone else's.

## ➡️ What carries forward

L5.3 automates the triage these incidents need, and closes the level with a
cost review that turns off a connector you have proved you do not need.
