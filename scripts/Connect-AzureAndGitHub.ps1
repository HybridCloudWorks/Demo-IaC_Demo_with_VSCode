<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Connects lab prerequisites: validates auth and forks the workshop repo to your account.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script uses your signed-in GitHub and Azure CLI sessions to:
      1) Validate GitHub CLI authentication
      2) Validate Azure CLI authentication
      3) Fork the workshop repo to your GitHub account (if not already forked)
      4) Install/verify the GitHub Copilot CLI extension

    After this script completes, use the fork URL printed at the end to clone the
    repo in the next step (Section F in the checklist).

    It is safe to re-run (idempotent): existing fork and Copilot CLI are detected
    and reused.

.PARAMETER UpstreamRepo
    Source repo to fork (owner/name). Defaults to the workshop repo.

.EXAMPLE
    ./Connect-AzureAndGitHub.ps1
